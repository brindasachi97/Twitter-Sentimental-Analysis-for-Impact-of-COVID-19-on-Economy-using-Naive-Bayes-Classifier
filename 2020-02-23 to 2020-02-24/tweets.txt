No infrastructure or healthcare programs in a booming economy, that will likely end shortly. Just tax cuts for the rich and corporations....and welfare to the once proud farmers. SAD!!

Social programs and socialism as an economy are two very different thing.
I think the people who are frightened by the word socialism, like your middle-class suburban slightly older group, think the economy is doing well.
Not a big fan of either, but I'll take Trump's economy over Bernie's every day of the week.

A course in Economics would tell you, America has a “mixed” economy with both socialist and capitalist features. The issue is to create an effective balance which encourages economic growth as well as humanity and fairness. We want a country with a strong floor and no ceiling.

I thought everyone was doing better because of the “best economy ever”.
You assume that Bernie’s policies’ll achieve the outcome you want. I don’t assume that. I think there’s a good chance that trying to implement them will not only fail, but result in an economy that looks lots like Britain in the 70’s. If that makes me a bad person, I sleep fine.
If you don’t know that a surplus is contracting the economy, then you need to go back to Economics 101. Hence, all the problems. Only exacerbated by ill timed tax cuts.

They’re sort of intertwined. Trump won’t let anyone say anything about the Coronavirus, for fear that China will be insulted and its spread will affect the stock market/ economy, so we’re in the dark about how bad it is. Thanks to him we are unprepared for a pandemic.I fear both!
I’d say that’s kind of a big deal. With very low unemployment and record high DOW numbers. We can always look at little details and say “this section is worse”. But the economy as a whole is doing very well.
The economy would absolutely thrive. The governments power structure would collapse !! And that my friend would be the single most glorious event in all of human history !!
Who is stopping @ PChidambaram_IN from speaking about economy? He and his party is spreading misinformation about # CAA and misleading the public and avoiding discussion about economy. @ Swamy39
They have signed a phase 1 deal which will help protect our intellectual property among other things. He lifted some terrify. So that should help things. But besides that sector of the economy, the economy has had its longest expansions period in the history of the US.
The CMT perspective is that *all* government spending is equivalent to printing money. Whenever they spend, they add money to a part of the economy that wouldn't otherwise have that money. # UBI is merely one of the things that it makes sense for the government to spend toward.

Economy has carried on as it was under Obama; job growth has actually declined (unless you count the "15M Ivanka created" ) Debt/deficit have under trump. It's the same as Reagan where he improved standard of living by running up the debt. Obama inherited a shit economy.

No, I'll never vote for a Socialist. At least w/Trump our economy will remain strong. Bernie will ruin our economy as well as keep our nation divided and polarized just like Trump. "It's the economy stupid."
I think this is where the disconnect is. The economy might be doing well in terms of stock market and unemployment rate but the majority of Americans are not doing well financially as a whole. Housing, cost of living, wages, consumer debt etc are all major problems

Bernie will crash all markets and plummet economy into a depression the day after the election. There is nothing demark about that. Our population is 100 times larger and it will not work. It will be the end of the United States. You idiots blaming trump is the problem.

Do most Americans think that Russia is still the USSR? Folks, it's been capitalist for decades now. I know this is news to many of Y'all. In the 90's unbridled capitalism led to an oligarchy ruining the economy. That's how cap works. It concentrates wealth to the few.
A Bernie / Trump race will force us to have a fascinating conversation about government's role in a rapidly evolving economy. Two clearly different ideologies, not just different shades of the same color.
Economy recovered from deep recession under Obama. Obama also appointed two Justices.
When he says "our thriving economy", he's referring to the piles of money thrown by the oligarchs to the pro-corporate, pro-militarist, pro-status quo corrupt politicians like @ GOPLeader
That's extremely expensive for a family in today's 2 job economy.
I think it depends on what the economy does between now and November. Trump has shown that he can pretty much do whatever he wants, as long as he can tout low unemployment and record stock performance. If those two things slip and he is ineffective at blaming Dems, he'll lose.
Seriously. WTF are you talking about? You realize that @ realDonaldTrump has armed Russia’s enemies, and devastated their energy industry, while growing our economy, providing jobs and strengthening our military, right? You think THAT’S Mr. Putin’s plan?

Trillions of dollars in debt is irresponsible. The economy was growing anyway not sure it would of mattered who the Republican president was.
We may be (finally) getting industrial hemp in SD, it's on the ballot this year. It'd help the economy.

Thank you Obama for the great economy Traitor Trump is doing everything to ruin.

The reason we have trump has a lot to do with the fact that the democratic party sold out to the rich, branding itself as 'the more cerebral republican alternative'. You & they can all gather in a palace & shit your pants over the idea of a just economy/society.
Guy who promised that trump would destroy the economy promises a communist president would not. Can’t be taken seriously.

Economics of an ideology is not interchangeable with the ideology of an economy. Especially today the diff is huge, as most of the political discourse if filled with economical, utilitarian arguments, while also not declaring its var.economics explicitly, arguing by selfevidency. https://twitter.com/KBULTRA0/status/1231724008795787264 …
This doesn't look like the housing bubble, but more like the tech bubble. Idk, because the aussie economy wasn't affected that much during the GFC because of China's dependence on Australian coal and other raw materials.
I don’t think the majority of Americans have read Seth Ackerman or Oscar Lange for that matter. They equate socialism with a command economy.

They didn't "nationalize everything," they have a smaller public sector as a percentage of their economy than Denmark and Singapore, as I've already shown you. The cause is hyperinflation, started by their decision to print money to make up for revenue shortfalls.
“Trump grew concerned that any stronger action [ ] would hurt the economy and he has told advisers that he does not want the administration to do or say anything that would further spook the markets. He remains worried that any large-scale outbreak could hurt his reelection bid.”

Eh, I think you're making it seem like Bernie is going to change our economy to Venezuela when there isn't really any evidence of that in his 30 years of public life. He's never shown any examples of corruption or law breaking.
Look, no one disagrees they made a mistake trusting the US but, it shows they must have done a decent job in most other regards if ppl insist on bringing this up as their only example every time. Thankfully u don’t use the economy aka global recession like others attempt
With Trump’s economy nobody has to live this way anymore. Those Obama and Democrats days are over.
Economy that President Obama built! VOTE BLUE
Supply side economics is destroying our economy right now!
The notion that Russia considered Trump a favorite candidate originated within our own Intel agencies. It would be nice to know BY WHOM. Russia would NEVER favor one who promised to build our economy, our military, place US political might on the global stage.

Ok. So far the infection rate is very high. Your choice if you think it's serious or not. China wouldn't lock down 1/10th of the world's population, build two hospitals in two weeks and decimate their economy for a mild flu. I choose to take it seriously. To each their own

Bank loans are going to be the the difference between life and death for millions of Chinese companies, which means that a legacy of the coronavirus outbreak is undoubtedly going to be a fresh layer of debt on China's already over-levered economy.
Lolololololo lolololololo. That’s to funny. The democrats say the economy is not that great , but you & Obama is trying to take credit for it. The middle class did get a good break. Yes the corporations got a break. That’s why they are giving raises & bonuses
Use the $1.5 trillion campaign funds raised so far to retire all student loan debt thereby unleashing consumer spending, household formation, and surging economy.
Many decades is a good start. The fascists thought the cycle of governance was 8 years of conservatives pumping lifeblood into the economy followed by 8 years of Liberals sucking the life blood of Americans hard work. Time to break the cycle and kick the blood suckers to the curb

Customers + employees are NOT in control. Yes, Wall Street IS capitalism. If you are okay w/ CEOs + bosses, you are for top down control of the economy. Tim Cook owns Apple. Apple controls x% of the electronics market, therefore Tim Cook controls that x% from the top down.

If it weren’t for the Chinese keeping the Russian economy afloat the last 10 years, they would be eating grass to stay alive and this is how Russia is repaying China. The Russians always have and always will betray the Chinese.
That’s wonderful sound bite material but your job is to serve ALL people. No matter if they are powerful or not. Your alienating a group of people that provides jobs and helps to drive the economy higher. Did Bernie promise you a high office position?

I hadn't thought of that. But I also don't know how people REALLY feel about the state of the economy? I think most people have now figured out that polls ostensibly measuring other stuff end up being "about" Trump, hence stuff like this https://news.gallup.com/poll/197474/economic-confidence-surges-election.aspx …
We don't need an economy to have high asset prices.
The # POTUS is traveling to India. Most foriegn countries in the world want what the United States has (Strong economy, Strong military, Strong trade deficits, Total oil independence) but without the Democratic interference. So why would anyone want socialism in this country.
The first primary should be held in the state with the worst economy. The state could use the extra money, and the country could learn a lot about how the candidates address economic hardship. # PrimaryElections
It definitely shouldered some of the responsibility for housing refugees post Syria. It may not have been as bad as some other islands. Amazing to think what it's had to put up with in recent history, with Syria and the Greek economy to contend with. Like you say.

Where are you getting this info? None of those numbers are correct. Obama added 8.588T to the debt. Trumps budget plans to add 5.088T IN HIS FIRST TERM. By those numbers, he’s on track to add more than Obama. And he was handed an upswing economy & should be paying down debt.

A social safety net in a capitalist economy isn’t “socialist”, much less “democratic socialism”. If you’re interested in the misuse of the term look no further than Bernie himself.
I agree. But if his life has been dictated by the exact opposite in both personal and professional spheres, not much going to change. His base simply cannot see the damage he’s causing on so many levels. Nor do they care, because you know, economy is great!

Singapore’s govt downwardly revised its economic growth expectations for 2020. This comes after the economy grew only 0.7% in 2019, the slowest rate of growth since 2009. Now, the govt acknowledges the economy could dip into recession in 2020, in part due to the coronavirus.

Your not right about that. Denmark is a market economy with a strong welfare system in place so a socialism light with a market economy on top. Bernie weren't wrong about the Danish healthcare system.
The most recent example of socialism destroying an economy was Venezuela, where a majority voted in socialism. It wasn't until years later when a majority figured out it sucked that the regime became autocratic.
The left find new ways to become more stupid each day. Now they want to abolish the CIA. They can't help but be deranged at this point. They want to take away free speech, guns, religion, law enforcement, most of our paychecks, and our jobs(in many cases), and tank the economy.

Do Trump voters realize it doesn't matter what kind of economy we have if we don't have a planet to leave to our kids and grandchildren? Plus, there is zero chance Bernie will be able to do much w/ his ideas in House/Senate. At least he won't embarrass us daily and is intelligent

I know others made cuts to social programs. Using it as a defense for why trump does it with a strong economy is what I have a problem with. He is making cuts and and borrowing. Not cutting deficit as promised.
Maybe 2050 is too far in the future for a sensible figure to be determined? Changes in the way the economy works precipitated by new technology may make the problem disappear. It's happened in the past.

Excellent Jobs are the American economy!
It’s possible, and I hope it doesn’t happen, that Trumpism will die out only if the things his supporters fear happen, because of him. ie, if the economy here were to collapse, and Trumpers feel the pain, they will lead the march to remove him. Germans were stubborn, too.
While Trump is very polarizing & says extremely stupid things, you do realize most folks are in a much better financial situation than they were 4 years ago? Unemployment is also near a 50 year low. Socialism has faired as well as abstinence only programs. Capitalism still works
Watever lah government mne pun But please settle kn this issues: Minimum wages Youth unemployment Education access Education equality Job opportunity Media freedom Keharmonian Islam Mandarin speaker only Yg slh tetap slh Dh i rengsek.
Student debt is $1 trillion in America, here it is rising, govt debt will never be paid down (23 trillion down south and 1 trillion here) as there is no economic revolution coming.Unemployment rate is a lie. Look at work participation. Both countries it’s 65%, lowest since 1970s.
50 year low on unemployment. Lower taxes. Yup I’d say I’m proud.
I’d say that’s kind of a big deal. With very low unemployment and record high DOW numbers. We can always look at little details and say “this section is worse”. But the economy as a whole is doing very well.
Under President Trump policies fighting for fair trade which created lowest unemployment over 50 years so do responsible thing young lady vote Trump 2020
Like the lowest unemployment rate ever for blacks? Hatred went up for certain, I can send all the you tube videos of Antifa. I can send a load of fake hate crimes as well
If I pave 95% of a road and you pave 5, you can't take credit for paving the entire road. All of these number we're good, consistent and Black unemployment dropped mostly under Pres. Obama. Trump doesn't get to take credit for everything just because he dropped 1/2%. He had help
Low Unemployment is a catch-phrase for corporations making money with a bunch of low paying jobs.
We are all gonna be on unemployment, going to college and living in our parents basements if Bernie wins...
Yes, I do know the different types of unemployment rates. I posted about this not too long ago since some claim Obama's rates were figured using U-3 & Trump's using U-6. U-3 was & is the official rate, but both reveal a similar pattern.
Hispanic unemployment rate at an all time low.
Unions killed US Steel. They deserved their death. Short sighted and lead the workers to unemployment within 3 years.
Preserve the union from what? Booming economy, lower taxes, deregulation, new trade deals, immigration enforcement, record low unemployment, criminal justice reform?
Wage growth has been over 3% this year for the lower income range. You have decades low unemployment, shortages in the skilled trades and help wanted signs everywhere. You do not need a jobs guarantee. Small manufacturing companies are doing well here but the $15
The minimum wage is bad because some some, especially those with less experience or work ethic, may not have much to offer, and businesses *can't afford* to hire those people for the minimum wage. Which, when it's too high, causes unemployment.
You're still arguing at the wrong persons. Don't worry, they would too. Did you know that the real unemployment figures under Obama had 25% of workforce without work for years running? Not just lack of want, but companies economically incentivized, to outsource. Trump fixes A LOT
I thought nobody had been able to find even one example of three generations of unemployment. But maybe four generations is commonplace, what do I know.
With record low unemployment and a surplus of jobs out there. I heard Bloomberg pays pretty well.
Maybe if you understand economics and history you'd know unemployment was at 3.2% right before the great depression. You know when they made the same economic blunders Republikkkans continue to make.
I think this is where the disconnect is. The economy might be doing well in terms of stock market and unemployment rate but the majority of Americans are not doing well financially as a whole. Housing, cost of living, wages, consumer debt etc are all major problems
I think it depends on what the economy does between now and November. Trump has shown that he can pretty much do whatever he wants, as long as he can tout low unemployment and record stock performance. If those two things slip and he is ineffective at blaming Dems, he'll lose.

We still got ‘em! And self-serve may still be illegal in some states that have high unemployment. Keeps a few more working.
@ WalshFreedom Geez, Joe. You mean he (Pres. Trump) does all of that and has reduced unemployment for all; is building the wall; rebuilt our military; gotten people off public assistance and more. That's what I call a great multi-tasker who will get re-elected.
Damn you Russia! Thanks to you we have lowest unemployment ever, soaring stock market, energy independence, a revitalized military....Damn you Russia!! Give us 4 more years if you don’t mind. Bernie will gut the military, embrace climate change and crash our economy.
When I graduated from high school interest rates hovered around 10% and unemployment nationally was 6%, I held 2 jobs until I was 30 to make ends meet. But thanks for the fairy tale.

Statistically I'm not sure that is true, most people are improving and admitting as much, but we shall see. Most wages are going up, unemployment down. Etc. But we shall see, and things can change between now and November in either direction as well.
That would've been Obamas administration. President Trumps administration has got the country on the right path. Low taxes, no unemployment, jobs and more jobs brought manufacturing back he's doing a hell of a good job. We gonna keep him 4 more years. No room here for Socialist

Maybe if you understood economics, you would know that the “natural” rate of unemployment is around 4%. Trump has brought it below that thanks to his pro-growth policies.
hmm if there's such a huge amount of unemployment why hasn't the average wage increased beyond inflation? if demand for labor is high, shouldn't wages go up? or perhaps all of those open and unfilled jobs are completely useless busywork jobs that don't matter to the economy. pic.twitter.com/coKYxXCD5X

Nice try but as a black woman I do not see anything different under the Trump administration. Unemployment among blacks is STILL double that of whites. And it began to decrease under Obama’s administration. We will not vote for Trump as a group.

You are cherry picking 1 group to try and make a point. Unemployment rate is the entire economy. It also means those farm workers will have an easier time transitioning to non farm jobs.
What President Trump did. ex: Jobs President Trump has delivered tangible results to the African American community. The black unemployment rate is 5.5 percent, an all-time low.

What’s wrong with burnt steak? At least we can now afford steak, because for 8 years under Obama/Biden it was a luxury most people couldn’t have. Obama/Biden was 8 years of unemployment, food stamps, losing houses, losing 401k and money in the bank. This is what Dems represent

Ms. Filipovic, what part of President Trump's agenda (not his gawd awful personality, mind) have you found so terrible? First Step forward? Rising business utility? Standing up to the Chinese? Lowering Black unemployment? He has done some really good things, hasn't he?
Tell me again how those numbers are obtained. Is it guesswork like the ABS does with the Unemployment figures based on a select group of 1400 people or is it electronic using a few million random people
Depends on if you are more upset about record low unemployment/ record stock market gains/renegotiated trade deals/etc. or "mean tweets".
What would you consider as “huge” unemployment?
The redesign was for increased security which minimises criminal activity, which saves money. As for the value of AUD, the RBA is targetting lower unemployment and higher growth. Since fiscal policy is non-existent to address this the RBA has to keep cutting interest rates.
Indeed. Much appreciated. I hope you enjoy unemployment. Catch up on days of our lives or similar.
The Democrats say their platform is change? What needs Changing? *Lowest unemployment in 50 yrs? *Lowest minority unemployment ever? *Record high Stock Market? *Best trade agreements? *Making other countries pay their share? Terrorism being systematically eliminated?

If you don’t want to pay back student loans, don’t take them in the first place. Also focus on degrees that actually allow a person to be employable instead of a degree that leads to unemployment.
You really don't get how that works, do you? If you put heavy taxes on big corporations, they'll just move a lot of their production offshore and never bring it back. They'll automate more operations, so unemployment goes up. Successful corporations are successful for a reason.
Gulp it down, rube. You’re his kind of intellectual...ignoring that Trump loves to sell the bs that the economy was in shambles and lies that he didn't inherit low unemployment. He’s just riding out the trend from Obama and lying to sell a billionaires/corporate tax cut. pic.twitter.com/13lePeJpzX

No, not a tough choice. Go with the candidate with a proven record of economic success - @ realDonaldTrump! Historic low minority unemployment. Energy independence. Rising wages. The return of manufacturing jobs Obama said would never come back. # MAGA # KAG
Did Obama ever have the lowest minority unemployment ever? Naw. So who cares about babies. At least it’s mom has a job now.
Job losses started before the Libs were re-elected. Hi he liberals have had the lowest unemployment rate in decades. And job numbers in the rest of Canada has been improving. Alberta is the only place,outside of maybe the maritimes, seeing job losses so high. It’s not the Libs
Low unemployment isn’t irrelevant, it’s a key to success. Republicans have to fix costs of healthcare/insurance and education, but also if we’d get back to stressing unlimited opportunity, hard work, achievement vs entitlement that’d go far towards eliminating anger/envy
Except our minority unemployment is at a all time low we have better trade deals than any previous administration could do find something better than the name calling if that's all you have prepare for another term

Be intellectually useful. It’s easy to squeeze jobs out of an economy with huge unemployment, Trumps doing it with historically low unemployment.
This government will never destroy an industry, even one it let get this destructive. The main reason is it can’t be seen as contributing to unemployment. Even when the effect is a net good for humanity in general. College education suffers the same
More to do in a second term. More judges, more tax cuts, and more low unemployment. And hopefully fewer Democrats in Congress.

I don’t think enough people know that you don’t get unemployment just because you are unemployed. If the company goes to arbitration you could easily lose.

Only a brainwashed, uneducated person would think voting for a socialist during the BEST economy and lowest unemployment for ALL races would be a good idea. Baffles me every day.
They still have to compete for competent employees. With the low unemployment/under employment, the bar will get incrementally higher, even at the bottom. It's not zero sum. It never was. Lets get Union strong again,as we were when we built the America we miss
It was that easy? Just by trump appointing someone, they want to leave on their own?! Good, that’s saves the taxpayer some unemployment dollars!
Ah yes, the minimum wage that forces people into unemployment if they can't provide work worth that wage, helps *so* much. Average wages rise, and average work hours decrease, *naturally.* Due to free market forces. Those things aren't somehow socialist.
If Russia is behind such great economy and low unemployment... I would say let's have MORE. Dummy mcmuffin

I was talking specifically about unemployment rates. Record low unemployment is a good thing, period.
Politicians always talk about the unemployment going down based on statistics, pols etc but what happens when someone no longer receives unemployment assistance? They are no longer on any statistical radar, So you see the REAL unemployment rate is purposely deceptive

The QE still trickles down in company growth, low unemployment, driving up wages & housing. True, min wage increase will add cost to companies, and potentially drive up inflation. I am hoping it will be negated by companies saving a bunch on not providing health insurance.

It will always be a conditional one - even now we are out of the EU mess. You can apply to live and work there. As for work, they (the French certainly) are one of the most racist employers I've ever had the misfortune to encounter. Maybe because unemployment is 9%..still.
BREAKING: U.S. intelligence community suggesting Russia is 'meddling' in an attempt to 'help' Trump decrease American unemployment even further, strengthen the US Military more rapidly and kill more terrorists by remote-control... is this 4-D Putin Chess, or what?!
4 Remainers to 1 Leave voter on every episode of Question Time, not to mention the £22 million pound Aunty gets from the EU annually. If the EU is so good, why is youth unemployment at record levels in the block. If you support the EU dictatorship, why are you still here?

Yang mentioned how we need to change headline economic measurements because GDP and the baseline unemployment rate don't show a true picture (i.e. real unemployment rate which includes underemployed workers would be a better measurement)

Who would have thought that Russia wants America to have the highest stock market .(401 blessing)low unemployment, strong military, energy independence best economy in years. I am sure that most Russian citizens would embrace this openly.
The record low unemployment for the African American community began under Obama. You’re just taking credit for it. Obama also rescued the economy from the greatest economic crisis since the Great Depression. Thank you President Obama!

Yes, we deserve the great economy, the low unemployment, the strong military, the secure border and the tax break. Trump is a serial liar about his narcissism. Guys like Schiff distort the truth just as often but in a far more nefarious way. Stick to fantasy sports.
According to Trump. The unemployment rate is 3%. Who are these people who aren't working?
It is amazing the Democrats are attempting to convince Americans Putin loves Trump's sanctions, booming economy, record low unemployment, record spending on defense, and military support of the Ukraine versus weak feckless Democrat who love socialism?
I won't. Same economic mess as Trump. Same problems with an antisocial President. Perhaps more unemployment, perhaps gridlock (since he won't compromise), and further polarization with conservatives. Krugman is an apologist who makes points refuting himself.

So many defenders of the current presidential administration's "success" claim it's because of "the economy," but they literally have no idea what that means. They just accept the boasts and hear that unemployment is down and the stock market is up, and that's all good, right?
You are correct in the video was edited. The point is, she minimized everything from the gold star families, to the ultimate sacrifice to the reduction in women unemployment by tearing up the document. She said there wasn’t a shred of evidence in anything he said! Look deeper!
Yes. After 12 years I was laid off from my higher paying job. Worried that unemployment would run out I took a lower paying job. 10 years later I'm still there. But less stress and much better work environment.
you can't prove 1 white supremacists thing he has done..black unemployment the lowest it has ever been, has given more money and funding to HBCU's, and his approval rating is going to double by 2020 election. He has cabinet members that are black, latino, and Cuban.

Trump's policies have lifted millions of people off welfare and unemployment has reached an all-time low. To say "The nation won't survive 4 more years of trump" is just an illogical statement and it makes you seem like you pick your candidate's rhetoric over their policies.

Isn't unemployment at an all-time low? And how can you free load ON £50 A week? That doesn't even cover rent. Unless the freeloaders you're talking about are the bankers you bailed out but who still got bonuses and have gone back to the same practices that caused the crash.
Depends what type of fiscal expansion. Claimant unemployment is up nearly 1/2 million in past 3 years as Universal Credit has caused the hiring market - welfare to work - to seize up. Also, ~700k of people on Tax Credits have income of £20,000 & over.
The rules have changed. Depressions don't all mimic each other. We have disguised unemployment which has morphed into 30-40% of low wage earners working 2 jobs to make ends meet. Wage increases have not risen with productivity increases. The gig economy with uber has killed jobs
unemployed. They manipulate the unemployment rate, attack healthcare and Centerlink, cut services and benifits, cap pension payments, cut spending on infrastructure, and block any policies from the opposition that could improve the lives off all Australians!!
Any Intelligence fool when they heard Russia wants President Trump re-elected knows the Russians wouldn't want the USA to experience four more years of a Great economy, high stock market, strong military, low unemployment, defeating Worldwide terriorism, and worldwide respect.

They are basically paying twice the employees wage to employ them (wage + health coverage + other benefits, unemployment etc.). If we shift some of that burden away businesses, their costs decline, making margins better, allowing them flexibility in how they operate
There is no shame in supporting the President of the USA especially one who oversees a booming economy, record high stock markets, and-low unemployment and who appoints conservative judges and seeks secure borders and orderly legal immigration. No shame in that at all.
Why would you want to elect anybody but TRUMP. When things are running smooth lower unemployment, stock market doing GREAT, 401K are doing great can you want to jeopardize all that with a Democrat. Trump is doing everything that he promised for all nationalities. 4 MORE YEARS..
Parents should pull their kids from her class...it’s sick. Go RESIST at unemployment

Russia will go to great lengths to get Trump re-elected. They have driven the US unemployment to its lowest and the Stock Market to its highest. Where will they stop?
Also took Obama 4 years to drop the unemployment rate below 8%
But if it keeps dropping we may see those willfully unemployed basically shamed into working bc literally everyone around them is working and for the first time reach full unemployment (which is not actually 100% but anywhere after 99% for reference were at 96.3% employment)
Brody, many people have jobs and thus won’t show up in unemployment statistics but the wages they earn don’t meet their minimum expenses. A subset of those are forced to find a 2nd job to make ends meet. You can’t judge trump’s economy by low unemployment numbers...

No, it’s in Employee Benefits. The majority of that revenue that pays for my employment is insuring Medical and Rx insurance. Bernie would take that away leaving me with unemployment. It’s why I couldn’t vote for him.

Sorry, @ charliekirk11 , I usually am with you on your tweets but this one just isn’t factual. I agree, though, that under a Bernie presidency the economy will tank and incomes will suffer, unemployment will rise and so on.
Lowest unemployment on paper... it doesn’t account for those who aren’t on unemployment or have quit looking, like the steadily increasing homeless population, many of whom work, but slave wages too low to afford rents, especially after gentrification.
Why would Russia want to keep President Trump in office? America is winning! Lowest unemployment, highest GDP, stock market all time high. Our military is prepared. More like they pray for pic.twitter.com/UGv3TDZ52C
What’s the unemployment rate in Scotland ????
Sure, bc even if you landed in the opportunity of the 90s and got that career boost, all it takes is a serious illness or prolonged unemployment to erase that benefit of Timing.
Wait! U are from Scotland?? Worry about the economic situation in ur country along with unemployment, factory closures, lack of industry & education. I think u should be criticizing ur government & not ours. We are doing super great except dealing with all these liberal kooks
Low unemployment. High stock market. Economic growth and on and on and on. These Russian meddlers are doing it wrong. My 401k is thru the roof
Get a job. I know many who are on unemployment because they choose not to work. That’s tax payer money. Get a job.
Spain's unemployment rate is still about 15% UK about 3.5% how is raising the minimum wage helping? It just drives other costs up?
We're starting this week of with a look at the latest # unemployment figures for Europe by @ EU_Eurostat . The Czech Republic has the lowest rate at just 2%. @ MikeQuindazzi # artificialintelligence # iot mt: @ MikeQuindazzi RT @ statistachartspic.twitter.com/MBA94twidR
So you’re unreachable, then? There’s nothing President Trump can do to earn your support? 7 million Americans off unemployment? Defeat of Isis? Ending the war in Afghanistan after 20 F-ing years? Giving $100M to Flint to fix their water? NOTHING?
Trump has kept the recovery going. Usually it would have leveled off well before we hit 3% unemployment or 3% GDP.
Low unemployment is good because it means the bugmen are maximising the life they can squeeze out of their wagies
If Trump wins(2016) we'll be involved in WW3, stock market will crash, wages will go down, unemployment will go up. It's been 4 years What do you have to lose?
Technology dumbs people down; isolates, desensitized them, and it's the reason unemployment is so high.
Not at all.. He dey come join the unemployment statistics
Im not sure if Le Pen could win, but im very confident Macron is done. Its the youth unemployment in Italy, Spain, Germany, Netherlands are the problem. Over population is leaning to government dependency. That's the real issue. Merkel has failed and her prodigy has stepped

Your take on 'socialism' Any form of taxation was considered 'socialism'.. drive any paved roads lately? Social Security? Socialism Unemployment Insurance? ditto Worker's Comp? yep Medicare, Medicaid? libertarianism is as dead as the dodo bird
For unemployment recovery bc he legit cant recover 7+% but they're lower than theyve ever been and obama said it was impossible I'll give after giving a second look that Obama's numbers were slightly lower than when he got elected but with a record slow recovery over 8 years
Low unemployment. High stock market. Economic growth and on and on and on. These Russian meddlers are doing it wrong. My 401k is thru the roof

At best you are arguing that trumps tax cut helped increase wages and lower unemployment. But that is not the proposition at issue
Anything but unemployment for those over 50... it’s a thing.
Poverty is being diminished right now. Record number off food stamps, lowest unemployment. Getting rid of billionaires will not create a utopia where all the world's ills will be solved. It takes hard work, not taking away from others.
Remember when he said the unemployment numbers were fake and were really as high as 43%?
"It is the economy s****d". The unemployment of minorities is lowest..in History! That means that under Bush, Obama and all of the other presidents, the unemployment of minorities was high. Sanders and Bloomberg can only dream to be in Trump's place.

CNN we the American people don’t care about what President diet is. We care about economy results We care about unemployment numbers We care about economy numbers We care about healthcare We care about immigration We care about infrastructure. So CNN....
Serious question...that I know you won’t answer honestly, but let’s have a go: If there was a guarantee that Trump would lose re-election, only if unemployment would hit record highs because of his loss and not reverse, would you be ok with that? In other words,economic crisis.
Obama brought the unemployment rate down five points, Trump brought it another point. # ThanksObama
Watching Bernie talk about Russia and Putin want's chaos and divide in the US, Wouldn't Putin want the worst most corrupt communist do nothing Democrat be President. Why would Putin want President Trump thriving economy, lowest unemployment, Strongest military ever in US history

Want facts? Strongest economy in 30 yrs, unemployment lowest in 20 yrs, record stock market gains, black unemployment down to lowest ever, wages up. Trump having record turn out at elections for incumbent president of all time. Reality sucks sometimes
Unemployment in all areas had fallen 1% or less in the entire time trump has been *president Your racism towards the previous administration is obvious
2006, 2008, and 2018 suggest otherwise. There isn't any historical precedent of success for a candidate running on the economy as a way of unseating a peacetime incumbent President presiding over a sub-4% unemployment rate.
It’s easy, promises made, promises kept. No one fights harder for ALL Americans. Record low unemployment, criminal justice reform, USMCA, my 401k is booming. The list goes on and on.

That’s your answer? Are you that ignorant? Middle class Wages since Trump upwards of 15%. Unemployment lowest in decades. Illegal immigration lowest in decades. Get an adult to help you next time.
Are you also tired of 3.5% Unemployment? What about the 3.2% Wage Growth? $63K Median Household Income?
Trump's booming economy and record unemployment created these expansions. # BattyPatty and big pharma are attempting to destroy it with agitprop equivalent to what they used during the cold war. Don't let crooked politicians fool you! # KAG!
To bring them back is bc he couldnt see the unemployment getting any lower we have a record low unemployment rate right now and that's with this new group of willfully unemployed youths popping up ex. I had a friend with very mild schizophrenia she takes meds and shes fine
Trump tells it like it is...no sugar coating, no 'political speak'. He fulfills his campaign promises, he loves this country & its citizens, there's historically low unemployment, lower taxes &, for the first time in a long time, people are once again proud to be American!
We already have socialistic programs. Medicare & Medicaid for the elderly and poor. We have Welfair programs, Food Stamps, Unemployment, and the BIG one, Social Security. Our government has raided,pilfered and laid waste to these programs for decades.

Oh FFS, Elise, I survived 8 years of Obama, you will survive and thrive under 8 years of Trump. Geez. 3.5% Unemployment
Most european countries are social democracies, not socialist countries. For socialism Bernie should embellish his speeches with examples like Venezuela, Honduras, El Salvador and other socialist paradises where unemployment and crime are super low , right ?? Oh no ...wait ...
That will cause businesses to close and unemployment to rise. Which leads to more people on government assistance. Then the gdp goes down and the economy crumbles. Sounds great! Btw, guess where many wealthy Europeans travel when they need real healthcare. That’s right, the USA.
"So, here is a thing that we've established," Kudlow stated. "In the three years of the Trump recovery.We've had lower unemployment across the board: every minority group, every blue-collar, white-collar, women, millennials.Even the 'snowflakes' have added two million jobs.
Hello this is someone who lives in socialist France we are not thriving we are suffering so much. Having universal healthcare, free college and unemployment benefits is awful please save us America.
Tony! I was just informed that I lost my job as Empress of Media Relations for the Buttigieg campaign because I liked your Susan Sarandon tweet. See you on the unemployment line
It's not Trump's fault that you can't get a job with 4% or less unemployment. Look in the mirror, you scare your potential employers away with that look!
I want you to win too. And watch unemployment raise to 25% and every retiree lose about 65% of their 401ks. Then the democrat party will lose forever.
He should be told the next intel they need is the current wait time in the unemployment line.
What is hateful about 3.5% Unemployment?
We are still talking about Jacob Zuma & the Guptas in 2020 while the country's unemployment rate is increasing. Loadshedding is nyising us Vat will soon be 16% Inequality gap is widening Whites earn 3 times more than blacks Black people need to wake up!
Same principle with Hispanic and Asian American unemployment.
Coasting on the Obama wave! Trump has been able to continue the Obama recovery for his first 3 yrs. Mainstream media are going along with the con but the story is starting to collapse. Unemployment is low because many working 2 or 3 jobs!
Remember one August under Obama the economy lost 83k jobs, but the unemployment rate went down... reason.. people dropping out of workforce or even looking for jobs.
Yeah because Russia wants us to have record unemployment, the best stockmarket ever and the strongest military in the world!! Come on who's really that dang gullible!
What outrages. You more, Jo, the 3.5% Unemployment Rate or 3.2% Wage Growth? Are you outraged by unelected mere DISTRICT Judges issuing nationwide injunctions against our ELECTED government, even though their jurisdiction stops at their District boundaries? The SCOTUS is right.
You’re giving him credit for Obama’s work. Obama lowered African American unemployment by nine points. trump lowered it one point. That’s like giving credit for winning a race to the mechanic who pulls the car into the garage.
@ Lowes is the same way. Here in Texas they were firing people left and right, ppl who were w/ co. for 10+ yrs all bc they were a few min late. I got fired bc they lied saying I didn’t provide cust serv, but TX unemployment saw the proof in security footage that I was right.

At 4% unemployment no less. Lowest in my lifetime of 47 years
You're literally saying talking points. Trump didn't lift people from welfare, he just changed the criteria to kick them off. Low unemployment says nothing about underemployment. It's a useless statistic
And if you don’t watch or listen to the news... how are you informed enough to say anything? And even if that was true. How would you know what to research. And I guess you missed the part about unemployment at 4.7% when Obama left office?
She should she’s got a 78 year old man who only bathes every other Friday drooling down the back of her neck! She deserves a new dress. Next year she’ll be back on unemployment.

Ma’am....the stats on the economy do not lie. What’s amazing to me is that you wish these stats weren’t true. I honestly believe you’d prefer that AA unemployment has risen, and subsequently worse conditions, then admit it to be true. See? That’s what hate does to a person. SAD!
Having gone through the process before of qualifying for unemployment, I'd much rather get the $1,000/mo unconditionally. All of the hoops trying to qualify for unemployment was a pain. I would be more productive to just focus on the next move than jumping thru hoops.
How dare they go through your public Twitter feed! Enjoy unemployment life, @ tonyposnanski. The universal laws of Karma are a beautiful thing!
Remember times when Trump used to say that the official unemployment numbers don't represent the whole story....
Unemployment at 9.6 was left to Obama AFTER 8 yrs of Bush. Obama left the unemployment rate at 4.7% so, really Trumps rate of 3.5% is such a drastic change now is it
How come Trumper's never points out that black unemployment is double that of white unemployment? How come Trumper's never points out that only 33 percent of blacks think this economy is good? Stop spreading your lies and white supremacist propaganda.
How unemployment would sky rocket
Or how the rise of automation and robotics may lead to an increase of unemployment and poverty causing a need for universal basic income.

Odd that you say that D are spenders. For the past 40 years, deficit booms under R while it's eliminated under D. If the unemployment rate is accurate, wages would increase; they're the same. ⅓ of US labor is underemployed or unemployed. What are your data sources?

The stock market & unemployment rate aren’t indicative of the real economy. The majority of jobs created are in the service industry. There’s inflation in rents & healthcare. The middle class tax cuts were underwhelming. The Fed has been pumping up stocks at the expense of savers
So Trumps supports Putin? And Russia is behind Trump being in office? Well guess you better start thanking Puttin for a great u.s ecomy, low unemployment etc. instead of Trump. It doesn’t make sense. Your a wacko sir.
Hahahaha! Throwing out the race card I see. Always find it funny for you dems to use the race card when Trump has done so much to lower black unemployment and has a significantly larger black base following him. Maybe you are u happy with “you” and not the Prez
Correct. The reason is because the more labour supply there is, the higher the competition because labour demand remains constant. As a result, wages decrease and there's a possibility of unemployment increasing. Sometimes competition is not good for locals. (Sorry for the quali) pic.twitter.com/xLHBpR6X9A

.....to the unemployment line?
The problem is everyone thinks they are good at reading stock market signs.

They’re sort of intertwined. Trump won’t let anyone say anything about the Coronavirus, for fear that China will be insulted and its spread will affect the stock market/ economy, so we’re in the dark about how bad it is. Thanks to him we are unprepared for a pandemic.I fear both!
Remember I warned you about the Bank Runs. GET OUT OF THE STOCK MARKET ASAP OR YOU WILL LOSE EVERYTHING. Warren Buffett will get a Bailout but you won’t. Elites plan MASSIVE COLLAPSE to blame on # Coronavirus. It’s all a ruse so they don’t end up in Jail or worse.

I'm not convinced a pandemic is good for BTC as many seem to believe. There is no safer asset right now than the dollar. The stock market will collapse and soon. I don't think BTC is immune from a big selloff as well.

It’s incredible when Mr Musk has been touting China as his new huge growth market this year, and no one seems to be concerned it may not come through? Also I think they are pegging the stock above 100$ billion do he gets that cash bonus. I smell some fraud
LOL. It started with Regan and has been going on since. I’m not a youth. This isn’t a question of party politics but of an economic culture that prioritizes stock market profits as measurements of growth while rural America is starting to experience third world-like conditions.

You can’t take it. Neither can Bernie. You are like man babies. He has too much money. Waaaa! Taking $100B from Bezos would crater Amazon’s stock and thd market would follow. Wiping out hundreds of millions of $. If not trillions. Very bad.
Farm bankruptcies up, growth down, deficits up, severe budget cuts except military, the Fed is financing stock purchases to prop up the market with money pulled from thin air. He is messing it up, he just has allies disguising and hiding the results. Shit will hit the fan.
who are the major employers in America? the small to medium size companies. are they on the stock market? No! you can manipulate the stock market as trump did by having the treasury invest billions in the bond market. normally they should be in tandem when not manipulated

Please help me out. How does Bernies plan on powering America by shutting down all coal and all nuclear and all natural gas? How is he going to pay for MFA? How does he prevent business from just going overseas since there is zero chance they stay with excessive tax rates.
Often it seems it’s just a way of shutting down a difficult conversation about something the business likes but doesn’t have a great fit with, you know, actual people.

No. The employer also pays a tax for the emloyees, maybe they have included that tax? To get a fair picture, one must look at the total costs for living. Like costs in the US for health care, or for your old parents. And one must look at macroeconomics, GDP per person etc.
Well when housing debt reaches 800 GDP some things look peachy. How did that happen?
Sure. GDP growth is about the same as Obama. Below where it was under the expansions of Bush Jr, Clinton, Bush Sr and Reagan. Manufacturing is in a recession and has been for a few quarters now.

the cost of college exploded as loans became detached from the results and the benefits of higher education. You now pay huge prices for useless degrees and courses that teach you nothing except how to be stupid SJWs! Gov't grows at 6-8% automatically while our GDP grows 3%.
Australia has (mostly) free medical care, funded by a surcharge on income tax. Our health system costs 9% of GDP, whereas the US's costs 19%. And our outcomes are superior.

Scandinavian countries have a history of social democratic economies (which was my point). The US has an economy with more wealth than those smaller countries. A single-payer system costs less as a percentage of GDP in Canada than what we spend on medical care in the US.
They want everyone to have it so they can force everyone back to work. C’mon they ain’t ganna cure anyone, they want it to be the next flu so ppl just keep going to work and making the mighty GDP tick over for another ten years or some rubbish. Full of shit! Closer the boarders
Take those numbers. 20x gdp, 10 times the population. The numbers just don't add up to paying more than what is paid in premiums and out of pocket
I truly do not believe there is anyway M4M would pass through Congress. If what candidates promised actually become true our GDP would be 4-5%, ACA would be complete overturned, a wall would be built and paid for by Mexico, etc. Also Sanders has an abysmal record of passing legis
I totally agree with this. But I bet 5.8% will be the official China reported Q1 GDP number at 8:1 odds. I realize it defies all logic but since they floated 5.7% previously I expect them to “beat” to inspire confidence. I think one can get 10:1 odds now if anyone agrees.
Well said. you listen to them proudly speaking about GDP and you ask yourself am i truly in the country

Scotland has been independent for a large part of its existence. They joined the Union in early 1700. London has a large GDP similar to a country, the Netherlands. Do you suggest that London becomes a country just because it has the financial numbers?

Contrary to the many horror stories passed on Canadians have excellent health care and the fact that the us GDP is far greater than Canada's. Roughly 20 times greater, the cost would be much less due to the fact that the wealthier pay more.

Actually make that 2.5% of the EU’s GDP... sorry..
Slash? The difference between annual revenues and outlays (the deficit) is around 4% of GDP. ALL defense spending (nearly half of which is healthcare and pensions, btw) is only 3% of GDP. So eliminate defense entirely, and we still don't have a penny for Bernie's schemes.
Took 500,000,000,000 approximate cost divided by 20,000,000,000,000 EU GDP which is 2.5%. (Sigh)
The president that made R economy the strongest in the world? Obama’s running again? Because the guy now inherited an economy from him-Obama’s job growth was higher, especially for people of color and the GDP was higher his last four years than all of the first three of this guy.
To the socialist, wealth is contemptible — except when socialist leaders are rich. For reasons we don't understand, it was fine for Venezuelan despot Hugo Chavez to die with a net worth of $1 billion, while the country's per-capita GDP languished at 96th in the world.
That could be possible— the key is that what happens if the Chinese market goes to negative GDP, and many businesses going out of business. That is going to have a ripple effect on the global economy if # Novo is not contained in the next few days.

I know but it is using Irish GDP and GNI as metrics. Both are so severely distorted that the CSO doesn't even use them. Anything that references Irish.... GDP/GNI/FDI/EXPORTS/GROWTH is wrong because all are severely distorted by MNC tax dodging. Don't shoot the messenger.

Actually our debt to GDP level is relatively low. The problem is that the interest rate (or bond yields) gov pays on its debt is too high. And bond yields are decided by the central bank who is the bidder of last resort...and able to bid yields as low as it wants them. pic.twitter.com/scwLx55b4o

Foreign Aid costs the same whatever its squandered on. The fixed % of GDP needs to go and Foreign Aid redefined as sending tents, expertise, medics etc to disaster zones.
Tax revenue grows as a share of GDP. Aside from the fact that Bernie's barely proposed raising taxes, social democracies don't use that revenue to nationalize industry, they use it to ensure people are taken care of, with cash assistance, public goods, and health subsidies.
It’s being taught in our universities! Too many European professors! Time to drain the universities! Also, the youth are / were having their future taxed awayby the democrats. Look at the Philly fed website as to how much of the GDP was being consumed by government under BO!
Adjusted for total GDP per capita, America is usually ranked around the same spot as Sweden. The only reason America doesn't already have all of the social benefits that Sweden has is that the wealth is concentrated in a tiny minority of wealthy elites who aren't paying taxes.
How can you be so chronically ill educated? We are the 6th largest economy in the world. Our GDP is $3 trillion. We represent 40% of EU export turnover and 64% of its trade surplus (£125bn in 2019). We’re smaller than the EU for sure but we are still a huge economy

J realized that you are in Germany, appreciate the insight but you should be concerned that a 1/3 of your GDP is based on car manufacturers that are falling further behind Tesla.
So 6 trillion for area of 10,000 square miles for area size Syria 71,000 it would be 42trillion or twice our yearly gdp.
Turkey to name one, it defaulted on its own currency assets in 1999 while already having a considerable portion of its GDP in manufactyoring and growing exports. Of course recession happens all the times and in a no deal scenario, get ready for a quite interesting one in the UK
Bernie would spend 70 percent of the US GDP on his free college bs and his super Radical healthcare plan that outlaws private options. Plus he wants more government jobs in the future. He is indeed worse. Most moderate Democrats are smart enough to realize he could be dangerous.
I've seen sub 5 GDP prints in most of the updated charts. And, duration accelerating as the trough may bottom later into Q2 causing demand to shift further out into the future and inventory levels to be disproportionately skewed. https://twitter.com/chigrl/status/1231599910191009793 …
With coal such a hot topic in Australia, it is an interesting fact that coal exports have actually subtracted from real GDP growth in the five years from the Dec qtr 2014 to the Dec qtr 2019. It is still an important export, to be sure, but it's already running out of steam
Oligarchs don't suffer from sanctions, Russia's GDP is nearly 4x Iran, sanctions are much less effective at harming the state. Both hurt the people.

So you are saying in your source data predicts that the uk will fall to 8th largest economy in the world. The £ has risen against $. That means our gdp is higher as gdp is calculated in $. Predictions are for idiots.
Are you kidding me...are you effing kidding me. India is almost 6 times bigger than UK in population. As someone pointed out the GDP per capita and HDI are the basic KPIs to measure the economy of the country along with unemployment rate and inflation. UK gdp/capita is 42,000$

Surely if all Sanders supporters and Democrats paid more it'd make a difference? Also, Sanders proposals have nothing to do with those countries - even just looking at taxes/spending alone. He'd take gov spending as a GDP% to CUba levels, not UK or Scandinavia.
I don’t know enough about it to full cover it, I just know it puts more of a burden on the economy which in the US is actually in a bad spot when it comes to their debts. It’s why I’m not a huge fan of someone like Trump, yes lowering unemployment and increasing GDP is good but..
Now ask them how much of their national GDP was healthcare prior to Universal Healthcare... it’s not an apples to apples to comparison and you know it so stop acting like countries 1/8th our size are models we can replicate.
GDP per person??? That is a baffling metric to me, can you explain it?

Absolutely true. But still overtook on the nominal GDP rank, that too by two spots, one of which was UK. So globally sabka hi kam hi hai. Slow hote hue bhi overtake karna aur bhi badi baat nai hui?
India is now the 5th largest economy in the world in terms of GDP. But in terms of GDP per capita, it is still at ~120 (somehow this is not covered by media) Both these stats are 2 sides of the same coin. A lot to celebrate but A LOT needs to be done.
One doesnt dismantle 7% of the GDP overnight without a lot of service disruptions. That could easily be fatal for people with chronic disease.
SK and Japan are more important for global GDP than Hubei, so economists starting to take note I don’t see how this doesn’t become global. Unless the approach changes (ie away from prevention and more limitation - keep everything open) it will get worse for global supply chains.
