I guess think "if Labor had been in power and $60b had been found behind the sofa" how feral the Liberals would have been, scoffing about the inability to manage money, etc. We've constructively suggested they use the cash to stimulate the economy, which is not out of the woods.
Now, you have deviated from the initial focus which is the Trump economy. Talking about renewable energy and animal extinction, I don't think he has prevented parastatals or organisations involved in that from doing their jobs? For oil drilling, that's of more national concern.
There is no doubt in my mind that Prez Trump will rebuild this economy. He was responsible for it booming in the first place & one thing we all know is Trump is the only man for this job
Trump failed America and he’s playing gulf, USA will show what we think of this worthless leader. Trump was given a 5% unemployment economy with 3+% gdp, now we have negative 8% gdp, 38M Americans with no jobs, 100k dead and counting
Low unemployment numbers and a soaring stock market didn’t tell the whole story about the state of our economy. Low unemployment rate is meaningless if workers are trapped in low-wage jobs
Thank god he did. The travel ban helped save lives. Pelosi and Biden said there was nothing to fear. Pres built the economy up, China tore it down and Pres will build it up again. End of story. Facts are facts. Unless you state a lie and think everyone is going to believe it.NOT.

The economy had been growing for 7 years when he took office. Obama OTOH inherited the “Great Recession” from Bush. Now Biden will inherit the first DEPRESSION in 90 years!
The size of the economy and therefor the tax revenue base, which pays for education, health, infrastructure, family well being, etc. expands with the number of times EVERY SINGLE DOLLAR is spent here. That is significant for everyone, especially now.

Many have lost jobs. Why all are so affected now? Before the Pandemic, our economy was going down & people were loosing jobs but no one bothers because they thought,their jobs will be secured. This is all happening due to government wrong policies from last 5 years. Accept it.
You're saying "fake news" like you understand anything about manufacturing opinions. But you don't: you're the one being played buddy. Trump's failure to manage Covid tanked the economy like never before. You're not "rational" buddy, you're blind.
Far out, imagine if you lost your job pre Covid... you are still looking for work in that economy and country that's now incredibly different. Going to be just as hard for you to get new work. But you will receive roughly half as much to live on. Is that fair?

One of the most frustrating parts of the economy now is this obvious ongoing belief that "anyone can write and edit" - hence why most of these positions are volunteer now. It's true that most people can write and edit. Very few can do so well, and consistently well.
Also that the elderly and infirm nearly always suffer the brunt of deaths from any virus. It's obviously not good, but it was clear from the get go who was at risk and who was not. We failed to act accordingly so we still saw lots of deaths and tanked out economy. A twofer.

This is not democratic proceedings when you are denying peoples lively hood. No time in human history has governments have shut down the economy because of a pandemic. I believe this will kill more people than the pandemic itself.
It’s not 1% it’s .26%. Significant. But worth shutting the planet down? And we know who the .26% are. The very old, and the very unhealthy. Quarantining 99.74% of the healthy? We could of kept the economy going and laser focused $3 trillion where exactly needed

He's opened up your state's economy with no ill effects. Imagine the alternative.
Not singular. But the Dems produced a wave election in 2018 keeping healthcare stage center-- despite the R's running on what they claimed was a booming economy. And this time Rs will be facing an economy far worse than what Obama handed off and 150K dead. Good luck.
COVID-19 is just as infectious as the flu, just as fatal as the flu and ending mid-May just like the flu. The only thing different than the flu about COVID-19 is the INSANE way we shut down the economy over it. Luckily red states Governors have come to their senses. Finally.
I’m in NYC, this virus is bad. But you’re right, it’s not about the virus anymore. It’s about Trump wanting to rile people up and blame Dems so the economy looks good and he gets re-elected. But he wasn’t there to comfort our families when thousands of us died. He let us down.
Depends on whether everyone that should have received funds got them I guess - otherwise it's placing some citizens under financial pressure because of technicalities. Also reduces aggregate demand in the economy. But I get your point!
Really? We have 20% unemployment and the Economy is in free fall while people die! This is tRumps administration! This is WHERE we are NOW! So tell me how this is so great! And the World doesn’t respect us anymore! Wonderful!Got it!

Week 4 PB is up! This run had a worse economy than my previous PB, but a pivot to six harvests with strong RNG and better prep for Summer still shaved a few minutes off. A few unforced errors (one in Summer and one in Autumn) denied me sub-55, though. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jicQfZZUVxM …

I'm not a genius but I want to tell you about unemployment. Before the pandemic, to be counted as "employed," you need to have worked a minimum of ONE HOUR in a week. If you did, they'd say you were employed. The economy was all bullshit, please dont let them lie about it.
By that argument, @ joebiden could argue that Trump has crashed the economy once, and he can crash it a second time

My grave concern is that we are socializing the economy. Government now owns most of the economy and we have oligopoly. For example, we only have 12 banks for a nation of 30M. Also, centralization is hindering any potential for other regions to grow: no local government.
On Memorial Day weekend Trump, a draft dodger, calls women skanks, fat shames them, & tweets pics with duct tape over their mouth. He baselessly accuses a citizen of murder & tweets obvious lies about his running mate. All while there's 100k dead Americans & a collapsed economy.
He inherited a strong economy. He destroyed it with his failed response and his response since is to go golf while the economy burns.
Please explain the steps in which trump built the greatest economy in history. It should be written down so the next person can continue trumps foolproof process.
Not in these positions. They are doing nothing and until the economy is up and running again we have a phoney government. And if and when the lockdown is lifted we will have no more need to pretend that these wasters are doing anything governmental
Republican political operatives are recruiting “extremely pro-Trump” doctors to go on television to prescribe reviving the U.S. economy as quickly as possible, without waiting to meet safety benchmarks proposed by the federal CDC and Prevention to slow the spread of coronavirus.
I don't believe it will have that much effect on black voters compared to other things. Neither did my friend. It's going to be about the economy and coming out of lockdowns.
Staying in doesn't save the economy... Remoaners bless 'em last throws of the Brussels creature
No way will I let down my guard. People who just can’t wait will die. It’s wait until it’s safe or risk your life and others lives. Trump doesn’t care about us. He want to open to save the economy and of course, Trump’s ass. He’s looking stank right now.
I totally see that. All healthcare providers and their patients face the same issue regardless of payer. Governments are under unusual strain. The Ontario economy is in a downward spiral. You need to accept that this is an even bigger issue than patient access.
@ realDonaldTrump so when is federally legal marijuana gonna be a thing. Could make pulling us out of this COVID problem a lot easier to get the economy going
I actually think you might be insane for not understanding how this works. The more people that "return to normal behavior" the more people get sick. It will grow exponentially too. Then bad things start to happen, like no icu beds, no critical care...goodbye economy.

A planned economy supported by of all people that new socialist, Larry Kudlow and the GOP. Welcome to the USSA (United Socialist States of America).
This "lack of enthusiasm" is ridiculous. He is getting out the words that need to be said about Trump, economy, and this health crisis. It would be inappropriate to be rah, rah, rahing right now. We don't need that. I want strength, empathy and a man who knows how to do the job.
He didn't build it the first time. He inherited a strong economy and tanked it..his tax scam didn't grow the economy but his disastrous covid19 response destroyed it with complete and total efficiency.
Post pandemic what matters is: 1 are you out of it? 2 did it ravage your economy? US answers no & yes World does not share western obsession with HK. China is stronger than ever right now.

Let’s wear masks when we go out so we can have a working economy, and also keep each other from being sick for months, and also avoid potentially killing our parents. But if you’re a lazy slob and don’t care if you keep your job or your family dies... do you, I guess.
The size of the economy and therefor the tax revenue base, which pays for education, health, infrastructure, family well being, etc. expands with the number of times EVERY SINGLE DOLLAR is spent HERE. That is significant for everyone, especially now.

Donald has always been like this and yet Hillary Clinton lost her own white, female demographic to the ***** grabber. As the incumbent with a halfway decent economy at least for billionaires, Donald would be the favorite. The virus is letting Biden (OMG) be competitive. Nuts.
Also record unemployment, collapsed economy, lowest stockmarket falls and falling GDP. Continuing trends set by a previous administration isn't a feat. Should someone really get credit for just not messing things up?

Small business is the engine of our economy and that includes restaurants. Take out orders are not the same as a restaurant full of customers. And that is just one sect of small business.

No one should defend them regardless. China signed a treaty and broke it. China used a bioweapon to hurt the world's economy. These are # facts. They've lost ANY credibility here!
Only if by some temporal distortion, Obama is reelected and Trump inherits the INCREDIBLE economy the greatest president of my lifetime leaves him.
Everytime you feel guilty for ordering stuff online, just realize you’re helping stimulate the economy
Democrats and their obligatory media would love to use the virus as a weapon during the election. They have pathetic plans to blame Trump for the state of the economy. We know the real virus America is facing are the Democrats and their agenda to crush America as we know it.
Bullshit. The economy was handed to him. Not only has he managed to crash economy, but he let the country down by not caring enough to act on a pandemic. Almost 100,000 dead & that falls on trump. This presidency will not go down well in history. America is sinking.
Yes please do. Let’s keep our droplets to ourselves. Let’s stop the spread let’s save lives, let’s restore our economy. We can do it. Don’t forget to socially distance at least 6 feet away from each other, wash your hands, don’t touch your face.

Thats a very different topic, but if you don't understand why there is a slow pace to reopen the country then that means you don't understand both how viruses work and how economies work. Georgia is open and running at 1/4 economy because people don't feel safe.
The fact is that both the left and the right wanted a shutdown for a certain amount of time and it damaged the economy. Both sides would be better off not trying to blame the other side for it, but it is too pretty an ornament not go after.
Good for her, she shouldn’t have answered the question and go straight to one or two issues that are affecting all Canadians, for example some virus that has been doing some damage for the last few months, or maybe the economy, but hey Mr. Solomon, please you do you.
Almost all evidence points to people not dying. Leaving the economy closed will, without question kill millions.
Nope. He becomes a trillionaire when AMZN stock rises to a point that his holdings are worth that amount at the time. They rise when investors on the secondary market assume that the number represents net present value for the company's future. Stocks are not the economy.
It’s almost as if the whole thing was a hoax and they wanted the economy to crash and keep everyone in doors. The amount of people blind to all this is shocking. Especially you with your intelligence.
Nope - they just never understood the dynamics of the virus, from the data. Much easier to destroy civil liberties and burn the economy - easy way out.

With stocks approaching resistance levels, it may need to see significant progress in the economy's re-opening or additional fiscal stimulus to break through.Neither is likely immediately ahead. So, a pause in the market rally is the risk. See my blog at http://www.carlfed.blogspot.com
The economy was built by @ POTUS44 after the Bush years. Trump inherited the rising economy and didn’t screw it up until # COVID19 Now 100,000 Americans are dead and he is golfing. # GOPCorruptionOverCountry # COVIDIOT # TrumpHasNoPlan
No he did not. He rode on Obama’s coattails. Now he has the WORST economy in the history of US, along with over 100,000 deaths on his watch.
He tagged a little onto the greater economy built by Obama which he then went on to destroy through his incompetent handling of Covid

Everything you spew from your mouth is either inaccurate or just a lie. Trump has the best chance to bring the economy back. But, you wouldn’t want that, cause then you might lose your perceived power. Just have a seat and let the grownups talk.

Trump just rode Obama’s economic coattails until his mishandling of the pandemic tanked the economy. Over 20% unemployment & increasing, debt and deficits spiraling and more tax cuts for corporations and wealthy individuals.
Where in normal conditions (not locked down), there is 3000-30,000 deaths per 1% of unemployment, in locked down conditions that could be multiplied even higher, due to no opportunity to escape poverty
I wish to have 10.00 in my bank account ! No unemployment pay yet :(

You can and should. He dissembled instead of responding for crucial weeks, making the outbreak far, far worse, and he and his party made the kind of payroll support that’s common in the EU, and has kept unemployment much lower than we have, a non-starter.
Next person I see flexing unemployment is going to be reported to the irs. I’m sick of seeing it spent on dumb stuff.
How can you be upset about the unemployment rate? What did you think would happen when all but a few states issue stay @home orders for 8 weeks?! And, many of these states still won’t let people work! Not to mention, those orders were from govs, not Trump. So kindly piss off!
I’m also afraid people aren’t going to go back once it opens again. Why would they? Most are making more on unemployment than they would at their jobs. What’s the incentive for workers? Paying people more for doing nothing. WTF

I'm not a genius but I want to tell you about unemployment. Before the pandemic, to be counted as "employed," you need to have worked a minimum of ONE HOUR in a week. If you did, they'd say you were employed. The economy was all bullshit, please dont let them lie about it.

You're the guy who thinks M4A isn't possible and wants health insurance tied to employers. In a pandemic. With soaring unemployment. Long hike off short pier with you, fat.
I’ve been out of work for 68 days. Denied for unemployment & just completed my college training to counsel those struggling with addiction
It's true! Biggest market drops of all time! Highest unemployment ever! Are these the records you want broken?
This would be awesome. Although I could use it (6 weeks furloughed due to COVID-19) waiting for unemployment. I will happily give half away.
If you send me money, I’ll be giving it to my mom who lost her job due to Covid and she’s not sure if she can get unemployment money. It would really help her out! $megzie0904

Caused by Democrats. Deaths mainly from Nursing Homes. StayHome destroyed Small Businesses and killed millions of jobs. Red States have lower unemployment and lower deaths; democrats kill people.
@ GovEvers 399 total hospital patients, 650000 people still waiting on unemployment for 2 months all the governor worries about in contact tracing,hire 150 more dwd. but a 1000 for contact tracing, you brag about some great job the dwd is doing, youre clueless people are starving
Nope.... I'd rather watch the ticker keeping score of all the deaths you've caused and the unemployment numbers.. Near 100K deaths and 40 million unemployed if you're interested https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1264690631701663744 …
Transform the nation? Like higher minority unemployment? Higher taxes for all.....including the middle class?
Definitely the latter but is that necessarily deflationary? Joe Public loses his job, but if the Fed buys his mortgage and prints enough for his unemployment/stimulus checks is there any less money in the system than there would be otherwise?
Also record unemployment, collapsed economy, lowest stockmarket falls and falling GDP. Continuing trends set by a previous administration isn't a feat. Should someone really get credit for just not messing things up?
Please like this comment, the money would be going to my mother who is an essential worker in Illinois making less money then people on unemployment.. I will share a video to pulte for you all to see me giving her the news if I won. Much love

Unemployment? Aka the money I can use that I’ve racked up from working? Okaaaaay buddy
I’m just saying someone who is retired and only works part time as something to do shouldn’t be collecting 500% of what they normally make while also collecting a pension. Especially when thousands of people who actually need unemployment aren’t able to get it

The state has no system set up to track fines and fees, which is why only about 50,000 former felons have been able to register. Judging from the hugely effed up unemployment system down there, I doubt they'll have a completely new system set up anytime soon.

I don't disagree with your point. However these payments are only for 12 weeks not ongoing like job seekers support. I would call attention to this part "work was underway on the possibility of a more permanent unemployment insurance". But if nothing changes this is an issue.

Here in California we've always been able to go outside, go to the park, go to stores, if you're bored at home and want to work instead of taking in those 1000 a week from unemployment, you can work in any of the many essential places that are hiring. Wearing a mask is no bigdeal

It’s more then JUST unemployment. It’s family’s who have lived 60+ years on welfare then there kids who go on welfare and refuse to get a job. It’s illegal immigrants not paying taxes and living off the gov. And voting when they shouldn’t. It’s so much more.
Yep, and there is food available. Unlike my friends who like I said, wait for rice on the daily with no unemployment help or stimulus... I’m done with this conversation. Comparing us to a 3rd world country is a joke and an insult to those that suffer in them.. Have a good one

Except livelihoods are lives. There’s a well-known link between unemployment rate & death by suicide and other diseases of despair.
36 million people have filed for unemployment during this pandemic- more than ever before. This is not economic success.
No, no! It’s the Democrat governors with out of control lockdowns that are to blame for the unemployment. It’s also Cuomo, Whitmer, Murphy and Wolf who were throwing Covid positive patients in nursing homes to kill our most vulnerable elderly.
If you’re going to argue for a policy based on the notion that we’ve had chronic underemployment for decades, it’s relevant that we haven’t had chronic unemployment for decades. Especially when the policies in place when the LFPR peaked are the opposite of what Joe is advocating.

Historically low Black unemployment and Opportunity Zones in economically depressed areas. Those are real programs that Obiden-Bama could have put into place but didn’t! Joe is all talk, it’s a mentality that he can take the Black vote for granted, well he can’t & shouldn’t!
It makes me feel sick to my stomach. I live in a blue state, never voted for any of them. My livelihood has been effected tremendously. No stimulus for my family and I’ve lost 50% of my salary and don’t qualify for partial unemployment. I could lose job next. Open up NJ/NY.

Keep up the pressure Senator. Essential workers never received their proper due! Many on unemployment will have no other income after July and Mitch doesn’t care he wants to wait and see! Democrats need to make Republicans accountable. November is around the corner.

Technically the State makes the decision for them. Go back if called or lose your Unemployment Insurance Benefits. If they're independently wealthy I guess they can tell NV to go F itself, but few are. It's risky and many will just have to accept the risk and go back.

The ABS numbers on job loss will show that this is simply not true. Our economy is not doing well, unemployment & underemployment are at ridiculously high levels and not going to get better anytime soon.
@ NYSLabor Aye NYS. I know were all dealing with a frustrating time right now, especially with trying to get thru to Unemployment! The advice I have, and way I finally got thru is to call on your designated day and keep calling till u get thru! It may take a hr. or 2!!

When seeking unemployment/promotions look out for terms like “fit” or “ideal” it usually means “yeah you were qualified but you are not white, sorry!” Example: “We’d love to bring you on our team but unfortunately management didn’t think you’d be the right fit.”

Do you have access to increased unemployment benefits? Did you have a 3 month emergency fund as a buffer? Do you live within your means? Do you have the ability to request a halt on loan repayments?
Have you ever tried to live on the minimum wage?Have you ever tried to "live" on the sole?.I Make 3 times the sole and I http://struggle.No one is going to choose to live on unemployment benefits.

I have NEVER heard of any “bank” doing this!! You CANNOT advertise for ppl to put stimulus and unemployment here then NOT give it to them!!!
Eventually, social security will bail out unemployment for certain states. Missouri will be a prime candidate. They’ve taken from it before and it will happen again. I understand it’s a lose, lose situation.
He already gave $125 million to illegals like a month or 2 ago because he felt bad that they didn’t get a stimulus check. No money for nursing homes, hospitals, unemployment or actual taxpayers. Now he and Auntie Pelosi are trying to dump more on them.
I read that people are literally not returning their employers calls and just blowing them off, that should immed. stop their unemployment. I saw that coming though, paying people 950+ a week to sit home was asking for this to happen, glad it's over in july
Bhuti Nandi isn't talking about unemployment she's talking about how people should not throw away opportunities.
this is KINDOF true. although min wage IS pathetic..the extra $600 brings max unemployment to about $20/hr. this is already becoming problematic for small businesses trying to give out their SBA loan. & just in general, $20/hr as a base salary would eliminate small businesses. https://twitter.com/ThatMandyNicole/status/1263968792419266560 …

Guido U better check the latest stats. The unemployment for blacks is over 20%. Trump came in on a Obama wave. He rode the wave and took Obama’s props. Lets see how he does now when he has to do some work. There are no wave to ride now.

Girl you didn't throw away your opportunity of studying. It's not about the unemployment it's about the youth not taking education or work serous.
I decided to honour my body and my feelings. I continued to refuse to work under the circumstances of being forced to wear a mask. Currently awaiting whether a response on whether I'm fired or suspended until this passes. In the meantime I'll just claim unemployment? I dunno.
Hearing my family talk about the unemployment checks and saying "This is more than I should make, this is encouraging people to be lazy!!" And never consider the idea that what they make is too small to live is amazing.
It's true, remember all that stuff under Obama like the pandemic that killed 100,000 people while he played golf, or the economic crisis that hit over 10% unemployment. Dangerous

Indiana is a republican state. Unemployment last month was a staggering 16.9%
Under president trump we have seen a widespread mandatory lockdown for a fake plandemic (said on Live TV we made right choice to lockdown.) He’s handed out millions in stimulus checks for doing nothing, more unemployment $ than ever, and unemp rates soar. Who’s socialist again?
Trump has passed prison reform. He has given money to HBCUs he has started the first step act. He has had the lowest Black unemployment. Biden has done the opposite of this. It's cool tho Cube, keep on propping up Democrats. The same people who have destroyed Detroit and B-more
NOTE: The crude agitprop employed by Biden: logical fallacy. Trump played golf. People died from the Wuhan Virus. Millions of jobs have been lost to the lockdown.

Just my opinion. But I doubt that any administration Republican or Democrat would do anything to raise taxes on Corporations or the 1%. This would have a negative impact on the stock market. Since the GFC all administrations have been beholden to the markets.
If you can't give up part of your life to help stop a Pandemic, you're pathetic. We all know people need money to survive, but without life, you can't work. If Trump would've listened, instead of thinking about the STOCK MARKET, we would have less casualties. Jerk.

UI, can you do a brief synopsis on what made the spot drop in '07? People have said it was the GFC.But it doesnt match. The stock market wasnt crashing yet when theU3O8 spot started to go down. I think it is good for investors to know what to look for and when it is time to sell

... (already priced in) and a lot of potential for losses if the mission goes bad. So, my thesis is that the market overhyped this news and exposed the stock to great value in selling short.... sorry this was long but just my thoughts.
