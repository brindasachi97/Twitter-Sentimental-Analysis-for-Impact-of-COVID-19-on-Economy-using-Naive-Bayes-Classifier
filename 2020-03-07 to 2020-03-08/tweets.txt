If a tax cut is to benefit the economy, it has to be given to people who will spend it locally and quickly. Trump's went to the top 1% of earners like himself. Does the working man voting for Trump not know this. Vote Sanders fools.

I know that's what he's been telling you but they are not all factual. The economy was on an upswing when he was elected. Obama created more jobs. The new tariffs will be paid for by the consumer, which is good for the treasury. America has always taken out terrorist. Nothing new
This is the rhetoric that you get from a government using Debt to GDP ratio as a measure of the economy. At least until GDP moves into negative growth and recession territory. They’re looking for a new ratio now
Canada depends too much on weak Loonie, I agree. It could be considered good for economy, esp. commodity sector, but economy should be strong with non-pricing competitiveness which will make economy strong even with strong currency which makes consumers rich.
No, that would destroy our economy.
Yes, but for whom? Economy (until recently) has been great, but it’s not trickling down to the people. We’re in another gilded age and Trump/Biden seems like they will just perpetuate that. Doesn’t matter if the Dow Jones is doing good and people are still suffering
The only part of that which denigrates the Obama economy (as opposed to fluffing Trump's numbers) is an unsupported assertion that his recovery was "too slow." Then again, it also fails to note that the Obama job recovery was the longest on record.
Our most vulnerable and creative populations are at risk - this is a small business killer. Small businesses are the backbone of our economy, are they not? I speak out about this, because I am not comfortable with silence when faced with tyranny.

Increase the minimum wage & the boss will have to let some go defeating the whole purpose. A UBI of 1k a month is close to a $6 an hour raise. Plus its will boost the economy big time. Why are you & your buddies so against lifting everyone up & ending poverty. Makes me wonder
What do you suggest when every case outside of the North can be tied to it? Put the economy 1st & allow free travel? Italy is about to face the toughest economic fight since WWII, this isn’t being done out of fear, its done to protect the 40M people who don’t live in the north. +

Dear The US citizen. There are politicians who want to provide universal health care. Your economy will manage. Your vote means that you live or die. Choose, or perish.
Tank the economy - but it will come roaring back.
I'm not sure if it's exactly similar. I think people who have problems with their economy, due to mental illness, drugs etc, would have real issues with prioritizing their money. Where as, here education, care, healthcare, etc. is all free and covered through tax.
In my personal experience I feel the prevalence of Ti depends on which subject you’re studying and in fact I’ve seen both Ti and Te. As an example, in the poli sci lit on the political economy of development—

You do realise casual workers get paid an hourly wage 25% more than full time workers right? It's actually cheaper for business to hire full time, unfortunately, the economy is so bad that most businesses just don't have full time hours to give.

That Christian establishments contribute to the economy is irrelevant here. The main issue here is using the scarce resources of a developing country to erect a building for one (of the many) religions in the country, and then declaring it a national symbol.

Two things about this statistic. 1. Is it really measuring what we want it to/think it is? How is ‘democracy’ being defined. 2. If ‘democracy’ = the U.S. today with its economy controlled by the 0.1% that’s giving them almost nothing but debt—well, can you really blame them.

Their whole economy is based on capitalism. They have a upper and middle class, which does not exist in a socialist or communist society. The only communist part is not allowing the people to vote or have a say in the government policies.

If you are or have loved ones who are in the vulnerable population, yes, worry. If you care that our consumer-driven service economy is going to be impacted, yes, worry. If you are a hospital worker who is already coping with a shortage of beds, yes, worry. Lives are at risk.

What's a living wage? What happens when you, say, increase the minimum wage to $15/hr., then the prices of everything increases to adjust for the increase in labor costs along with higher unemployment and less capital investment?
So you think it would have been better to let the economy go into a full blown depression with unemployment rates of 20 to 25%?

And not to be forgotten, many people have simply stopped looking for a job, along with those that hold more than one job at a time which skews the unemployment numbers.
Maybe they divided the job up, employing 100K workers each to move a shovel of dirt and in so doing decrease the unemployment numbers?
Sorry to hear that. Just curious, and i know this is none of my business, so feel free to tell me to sniff farts, but did the whole deadspin thing affect your eligibility for unemployment? (I just spent 14 months unemployed, this is something i care about)

What life will these refugees have in Albania it is one the of poorest countries in Europe with high unemployment!
And today black Americans enjoy the lowest unemployment rate in history. Thanks @ realDonaldTrump for finally doing something FOR the black community instead of to it under the @ BarackObama admin.
President Trump has delivered significant funding to historically Black Colleges, set up economic opportunity zones, signed criminal justice reform & the Black Unemployment rate is at the lowest rate it's ever been.
Most folks don’t take that into consideration. The unemployment rate for autistic adults is around 85 percent. Many employers simply aren’t willing to accommodate our specific needs and requirements.
It'd go like his summit on social media: he'll ramble about low black unemployment and then go back to the corporations the following week.
Oil price war has added another layer of shit onto this. There's lots of weak balance sheets out there that can't survive one. US Shale is going to get decimated. Unemployment spike is going to be sharp. Household debt problem will come alive. Banks are gonna get cooked.
Except this is end of a very late business cycle (unemployment 3.5%) and the system will try and deleverage hard into a vicious cycle of rising unemployment. Your scenarios are somewhat cycle position agnostic

For sure. The economic measures that matter to working class people are not the same as the ones that you see in the business press. My wage has never been directly determined by the GDP or GNP. The quality of my job has never been determined by the unemployment rate.
In 1960, blacks had a lower unemployment rate than whites. And fewer children born out of wedlock. The Projects are the result of Democratic policy. Yes. Studied. I am reformed Liberal.
More people from escape from capitalist latinamerica everyday than Cubans. Despite of unemployment, they have a lot things millions of Americans can only dream of. It's easy to be fooled by the dead American dream.
They won't, they wouldn't if there were a case 100 miles from here, then they say they had it and not bring a doctors note when they come back. Then try to claim unemployment when they got let go for their 9th absence in 30 days. Again, I have great employees,these are the idiots

FDR won in a bear market with high unemployment. I am a supporter of the Green New Deal, but I don't think Bernie could pass it with a Republican majority in the Senate. Also, Warrens plan was better. He should have supported her after his heart attack, or before it.
galaxy brain take: unemployment is fine because beyond a certain level, wages go up (the fucking HORROR!) so we will hold 3-6% unemployment, which defies comprehension & shoves people out of the workforce. this is totally a real & sane country, folks!

You know what ash your right trump is so evil, so evil in fact that he created so many jobs that made blacks and Hispanics low unemployment ever, made the economy skyrocketed with record high, he freed a lot innocent people (which mostly are blacks).

Time will tell & when the LNP stimulus fails (which it will) come back then AfterThe last recession it took 10 years for the unemployment levels to return to its previous level & there wasnt the under employment issues we have now All we will get is marketing & spin nothing else
And lower unemployment will drive-up the demand for labor, which will drive-up wages. Which has already begun, first time since wage stagnation from 1970s. Build that wall!
I saw it the # ge2020 tallies. A commuter town like Arklow voted 45% Sinn Féin. There's only approx 10% unemployment in Arklow. They're people "WHO GET UP EARLY IN THE MORNING" with every day jobs & long cummutes in middle income bracket. Former FF /FG voters. The squeezed middle.

A job? In this economy? Kidding, this is the most non sequitur. Especially when having a job, while we think we control, is often controlled by environmental factors. When unemployment was 9.3%, during the recession, does this mean there were less men in the US?

Doubtless because of the risk that with rising unemployment people will be forced to sell their homes, which means for many a situation where they end up selling for less than they paid. Falling prices also equal investors offloading and prices fall further.

They seem to like digging in the past unless it applies to Bernie. The first time Bernie held a regular job (not sporadic or supplemented by unemployment or welfare) was 1981 when he first was elected mayor of a small city by 10 votes. His son and the boy’s mom relied on welfare.

unemployment is a lagging indicator. fiscal stimulus is used to buffer the impact of a correction/downturn. more than likely you'll see unemployment numbers increasing in march reports.
A UBI ( universal basic income ) pegged to the living wage makes sense for a low wage, high unemployment economy with sluggish activity in industry sectors. Diversifying the economy away from it's reliance on commodities into a knowledge based manufacturing economy needs a plan.

Hey, @ realDonaldTrump , you do realize that while people in the US are dying, so is the economy. Tourism is down. The mom & pop shops will shut down, lay off, cut back. Unemployment will skyrocket. The new depression will happen very quickly. Before November.
As for these “good times,” have a look at the chart of unemployment during the World’s Biggest Carbon Tax. Giving Labor a second term did as much harm to employment as the GFC itself.

Tax cuts, booming economy, 2 conservative SCOTUS judges, several conservative judges appointed at the federal level, and record low unemployment. For a fraud he’s doing a great job.
damn unemployment rate in pakistan must be at an all time high rn
He will soon be hitting the unemployment line
After Pres Trump eliminates Biden/Obama policies, we have booming economy and lowest unemployment for ALL, black, brown, white. Why go back to Biden/Obama's Hope and Broke Economy. Hope = hope you find a job.
More unemployment-they are ready to kill for less money-same budget fo bigger number of thugs. Modern Nazis are not working for free
You choose smug and greedy politicians over frank ones. And look what happened. Violence, poverty, unemployment. Would it kill you if you dared to imagine a different, better world?
The impacts of this pandemic on service workers are super shitty, there should be a large government bailout for small business and a large increase to unemployment benefits.
the look of unemployment and if the dictionary were to describe words, then a Democrat would be the photo to describe "trashy" and "uncouth", even "mediocre".
I could use the help. I have kids 7 Kids and was laid off 3 days after xmas. Been looking for work,applied for unemployment and still haven't received it yet. 3 months behind on rent. Anything would help.
Travel industry (airlines, hotels, casino, cruises) will be impacted. Manufacturing in China has slowed a lot (everything is practical made in China). Sporting events (fans not going or not being allowed). As business slows, unemployment. Less $, less spending. US will suffer.
Nope. He has stood against multiple presidents (Bush, Trump). He is all talk and no show. Unemployment among minorities is the lowest in 50 years under Trump without support from John Lewis. He has quit on the Afro-American people.
Youth unemployment up in the sky, infrastructure needing major government spending, budget deficit as deep as a middle age poet, and politics as stable as a chair with two legs... will FTSE MIB trigger this crisis?
I am also way behind in my rent, by like 2,000 bucks & my unemployment is a out to run out. I live on the Oregon coast & it's rural & our bus system is scattered at best. I desperatly need to be able to drive again. Please, consider helping me Sir, thank u!
They don’t want to admit. These employers are reaping big from the unemployment rate. They know there’s a pool of free labour at MUK and those people can do just about anything for free. Plainly, it’s being taken advantage of because hey, you need the experience.
I need to compensate a 2 month unemployment gap. March and April.
Let's just see Jobs numbers are up Our military has been rebuilt and better than ever Unemployment is low Minorities are enjoying more and better paying jobs I think things are pretty great right now and so do many others that have enough brain cells to understand that as well
the dems say they are diverse etc etc. however they are the farthest thing from accepting n diverse!!! such hipocrasy Is just seeping out of their whole being !!! its really sad to see they want to keep.people of color on welfare and unemployment!!! we are not stupid!!
some companies do give you sick leave, it's combined with vacation pay and often tops at 2 weeks a year, you get sick, less vacation, and then you just aren't paid or lose your job. Oh yeah, you only get 3 years unemployment throughout your lifetime, that's it in the US.
Me please! Am on Unemployment & need my driver's license restored & new car insurance. My license was suspended & time is up on that & can be restored anytime, I just need the money to do it. I have a car & just put 700 bucks into it. Am trying to get my life back together!
i hope itll be me its been 5months since i got unemployed and still havent gotten unemployment benefits
You already have one that understands that. Hence why unemployment rates are historically low across blacks, latinos and women. Trump 2020!!!
Yes, thats why Yes Bank is shutting down. Bhakts and brains, just can’t go together. And this is not the first one, but 3rd bank which is going this way. BJP is cleaning up. Then tell me what is happening to GDP, unemployment rate, USD. Wo sab bhi UPA kee karni hai.
you could just... you know... leave them alone, and not take their stuff. Then all of this drama you are causing can be avoided. BTW, how's unemployment?
Education is your friend.... But uneducated haters at least have a purpose. Trump says your welcome for the best economy and lowest unemployment the most jobs added in the history of the country. Just keep hating life and America it's OK its your thing you gotta have something.

It’s hard to calibrate. I mean, Wuhans 90 million population is a ghost province no one going outside, to work etc. Universities like Stanford are cancelling on campus course work, schools in Japan are closed, stock market plummeting, supply chain disrupted.
I feel like the Cardinals Management is like a bad investor. If you make a bad decision in the stock market; you dump the stock and move on Cards management is hold and hope stock will rise instead of looking for better opprtunities

"You can't become a big winner in the stock market until you learn to be a good seller as well as a good buyer." William J. O’Neil
You’re right Neal...unfortunately Trump and his toadies (who are in charge at the moment)don’t give a shit about anything except the stock market, hence the faux concern, with no actual plan in place..except for hope the whole thing blows over before the election
Ironic that the older generation is most likely to support him & now they're the ones most at-risk of dying from Covid 19. In his rush to help the stock market he could be sacrificing their lives to have good "numbers". Stocks don't help dead people.
1m apart please, maybe 2. Remember they aren't testing so the stock market doesn't crash further. You know, money being the root of ALL evil. I know you can't say it, but you must know Trump a dangerous fool.

We have no actual leadership here in the US, it has been up to local officials and state officials to make the right decisions, trump too worried about the stock market
Donald Trump and his administration to not care about America. They care more about their money and the stock market
It seems this administration is at its crescendo. C 19 virus, federal judge speaking, stock market tumbling, trumps men doing time. The pitch is almost glass breaking and the dominos are falling. Is this the world spinning on its axis & natural reactions, or man made? (-C 19)
Just like the stock market never goes down? The needs to go to work for the Global Warming Cabal.
And more rational folks also is having trouble believing the CDC and anything coming out of this Administration because they are so worried about the stock market and the election. So basically- nobody believes the CDC.
And the stock market rose for Obama! April2009 to April 2010 25% gain! It’s amazing Wall-street wasn’t concerned about swine flu fears??????

At least someone is adding to this economy and the mediocre GDP! Trump can’t possibly think his economy is as good as Bill’s or Ron’s (well of course he can but it’s just another lie). Low unemployment with a slew crummy jobs and most that are still under 35 hours a week!

The pursuit of GDP growth is about well-being--but only for the select few who have shares in it or whatever. The pursuit of well-being first is about everybody. That simple truth is completely beyond the LNPIPA people who do not care about the average person
But it hasn’t though. Gdp and the stock market are at record highs. Consumer CPI is stable so where exactly is the inflation ? It’s not a linear relatiobship
