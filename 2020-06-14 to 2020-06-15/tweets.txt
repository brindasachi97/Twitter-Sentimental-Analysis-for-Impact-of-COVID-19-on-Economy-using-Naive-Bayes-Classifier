and that one sidedness is why China will NEVER be a threat to the USA.. Nor will we ever really be much of a threat to them Our economies rely on each other's. if ours goes down so does China's. If China's economy collapses, ours would be next.
Ah yes, that radical left flank. And which is the most problematic of their radical demands? Is it their demand for justice for all, equality for all, respect for all, a clean environment, a fair economy, health care, housing? Which dream is a bridge too far for the critics?

Recovery from recession and depression is always dependent on Consumer demand. When in one or more fiscal quarters Consumer demand is decreased via personal debt, loss of income, and a virus it becomes a paradoxical situation that re-opening the economy doesn't fix in long-term.

It’s all incredibly sad, that there were so many like him who have voted us out. Still.... there will be fewer foreigners on his bus so he’ll be happy. I doubt the penny will ever drop about damage to our economy and if it ever does it will be somebody else’s fault next.
# EEUU # Economy Consumer sentiment data for June highlight a quiet day on the economics front. The U.K. reported a catastrophic 20.4% decline in GDP for April, showing the economy dropped by more than a quarter from its pre-COVID peak!
On Jan 15, 2020, the stock market hit an all-time high of 29,000. That same day, the Democrats delivered the "Articles Of Impeachment" to the Senate, and the first case of Covid-19 arrived in the US from China, setting the stage for the destruction of our Trump's booming economy.
It's that or a new yacht. Gotta keep the economy going.

The reason why unemployment is such an issue now is because the federal government had 60+ days to respond to the disease and instead, did nothing but deny. If we are not careful, we will be exactly where we were in March. Careful means: facemasks, distance, hand washing.

It's a bogus claim. Only 10-25% of unemployment recipients that they're getting more from unemployment than their jobs. Second, Americans have a commitment to work. Finally, channeling Bernie, God forbid that some folks get a few bucks more than their jobs would have paid.
You remember the violence during that time correct? The riots, the civil unrest. GDP was down, unemployment averaged over 7. 90-92 were tough times.

Extra unemployment money encourages people not to work in pandemic, economics chief says
Wait, isn't unemployment like 14%? And provide for our people? You do realize good insurance for a family is upwards of 500 dollars a paycheck, right? You lack empathy as most Karen's do, you rather focus on economics and $$$ rather than the quality of life we live.
That’s the problem isn’t it?! It’s pretty bad when people will stay on unemployment instead of going back to work, because the job doesn’t pay as much... or at least enough to make a difference

Not true. Unemployment was at an all time low in 2019.

The hole @ POTUS Trump has put us all in is fairly deep. The current unemployment rate is over 13% and if anything that’s an underestimate and that’s a very very bad state for the labor market to be in. It’s worse in fact than at any point during the Great Recession. # VoteHimOut

No. It would give people choices about their unemployment. Add in health care that is not tied to jobs and now workers can walk when employers misbehave. Can't tell you how many times I wanted to do that but for the paycheck.

Amazing that they see the problem as people not wanting to return to work instead of them making more on unemployment.
There were 100% new jobs created from this pandemic. Amazon and other door delivery services made a bucket load. They won’t lose unemployment if they don’t get called back, and they make more anyway not working.
For every customer from every road in every area that doesn’t return to a book, shoe, clothes shop they’ll be more unemployment. These places have to be attractive and competitive to be able to pay their overheads. Interesting to see if any will break rank & welcome custom back.

Hopefully he boosts the economy again because it's dying out due to the "pandemic". He is trying to get companies to build more here not outside USA. In turn should put unemployment at a near 5% over the course of time after recovery.

I think John Cusack will suffer long term unemployment soon.
Except for those making more money taking US unemployment insurance than working right now. That brings up a whole different conversation, no?

It's the tiniest concern I know. Obviously living is priority. But I'm afraid ill never travel again as nowhere will accept an American in their country because we're like this. ( and my unemployment running out . Which will be very scary for us 20%+ with no work now)
Still no closer to cracking the early 70s Ron Wood "vomit tone". It's not the guitar. No one is buying a Zamaitis, even w unemployment.
That’s not the case in Seattle, unemployment went down with a regional living wage
Also the $600 fed money is on top the state unemployment. It was ever meant to be temporary.
Girl soon as unemployment hits I’m getting a reduction
That’s the new projections for the morality numbers by the end of this year. Trump ignored this virus: blamed Democrats on the “hoax”; “close to zero”; dangerous “cures”, etc. The US now has the highest unemployment rate in the Western World because of Trumps incompetence.
Has anybody filed for the PUA unemployment and gotten paid yet? I just have a question lol
With the enhancement for Covid-19, unemployment insurance now pays a living wage where many of the lost jobs did not. To 'encourage' a return to work, Republicans are in a hurry to end the benefit, but lack any interest in raising wages.
Anybody that has had to deal with the UNEMPLOYMENT SYSTEM IN FLORIDA during this pandemic knows Matt is one of the reasons it’s such a circus and not paying the constituents the money that was alotted to our state for pandemic unemployment relief.
Trump adviser Larry Kudlow says the federal government should stop topping up unemployment payments at the end of next month and shift instead to providing ‘some kind of bonus for returning to work.’ https://www.wsj.com/articles/kudlow-urges-replacing-unemployment-benefit-boost-with-return-to-work-bonus-11592151941 … via @ WSJ

I never even got my 1200... or my unemployment. Frickin capitalism.

@ SpeakerPelosi asking for Congress to further extend unemployment extensions. I have been out of work since end of Dec. Almost had job offer when COVID 19 hit. COVID19 is still here, and jobs are still holding.
Is this supposed to reduce unemployment, or stimulate the economy, or....?
And unemployment and anyone who’s registered to vote in the American election has been cut off
Most people don’t know because the media don’t tell them, that in February 2020 black unemployment was the lowest it’s ever been, trump passed the 1st step act...there was police reform, so...what is the systemic racism? For Democrats it becomes an excuse for not fixing problems
@ SenSchumer @ PAHouseGOP @ senatemajldr I hope you let america know about extended unemployment this week. This is going on to long and we can not find work. It's unfair and unethical to treat us like this. I am more than furious anyone else please chime in. My Bill's due no food.
April - Unemployment 14.7 Lost ~9 million jobs May - Unemployment 13.3 Gained 2.5 million jobs Here in Colorado, people are getting out. Shopping malls are full, stores like Ross and TJ Maxx are having a hard time staying stocked.
I'm sorry you feel that way. But I have to say there's more progressives that are trying to tear us apart then "Orange Bad Man" is. And before covid-19 struck us unemployment was at an all time low. And lastly if he's a dictator why did he let the Governor's handle protests/virus
well where is your proof they are? CDC reduced their numbers, Virginia has, Pennsylvania has. Where are all the bodies from NYC? Why are hospitals going bankrupt with drs and nurses on unemployment?
This is what gets me! U in a crowd w/out masks. Im sure you “worked” all week or maybe collecting unemployment but for some of us, we had to shut our businesses down w/out that wonderful PPP loan. So please just fkn relax & chill. Do we really want to more? # pandemic # COVID19
What is a disincentive to to work in10%+ unemployment? A functioning frontal lobe?
The republican leadership has explicitly said that the extra $600 for unemployment won’t be extended. They feel like this creates a perverse incentive that discourages rehiring. I do agree that more stimulus of other kinds is likely though.
? Sure pal. Please elaborate. I have provided, and continue to provide service to society. Meanwhile loafs collect unemployment, while millions of jobs are open. Criminals are idolized. And vandalism is rampant.

Also Trump admin is refusing to extend $600 extra on unemployment benefits.
It occurs to me that the $511,000,000,000 that the Trump administration is hiding from tax-payers would go a long way towards extending unemployment benefits and helping people feed and house their families. – at Free STD Clinics

Also the govt paid 1200 for COVID relief for 3 months and some people still didn’t get unemployment.
Hmmm, guess she didn't qualify for the Unemployment Overcompensation Benefits.
I think that’s bullshit if someone just won’t go back to work. I would love to be doing what I enjoy right now and working. It’s not like I don’t want to... a lot of others are in the same boat as me. I do think state unemployment agencies will eventually catch those people.
I think Trump was favoured before COVID-19, but with all the chaos doesn't help. Also no US president has ever been re-elected in last 50 years with unemployment over 10%. Last one to achieve this was FDR.
did the government open up the states to get people off unemployment, OR to expose the celebrities under house arrest because of child sex trafficking
@ realDonaldTrump Happy birthday Preseidemt Trump! Please fire Larry Kudlow, he's wrong on everything! COVID-19 cases are rising, recruiters in Charlotte, NC tell me there are no job opportunities right now and won't be until September. Extend unemployment or you'll lose election!
they are sending sexworkers out to die by excluding us from pandemic unemployment assistance
That's because of corona, before corona it was the opposite. Highest the stock market had ever been. Lowest unemployment rate ever. But okay keep going
Indians understand that money doesn't come free... So in a way they never expect govt for help. Same goes for unemployment... Except for media people introspect their skills ki why I am not getting work.

That is very true. What I don’t understand is that we are 3 1/2 years into a new presidency. What does Obama have to do with it. We have 116k Americans dead from C19, 13% unemployment, 6 trillion debt, unexplained firings of IGs, hidden bailout money. All of this is NOW!
State Unemployment is meant to bridge the gap until you find work. It allows to scrape by and survive. Pandemic Unemployment gives you an ADDITIONAL $600/week! So whatever your current income was, tack on another $15/hr to sit at home. This is why people don’t want to work.
Those who survived unemployment, lost business bankruptcies and the Coronavirus will now have to face a much worse threat I mentioned before: Hospital Bill Bankruptcy.
Says the dude who committed the largest Medicare fraud in history. Also built the unemployment website deliberately the way it is. And, that unemployment is STILL at $275/week. You are a fucking joke.

This seems right. Right now we have a chance to get out ahead of that with some sizable bailouts and extending the unemployment benefits.
More than 1.5 million sought state unemployment benefits last week as layoffs spread to more job categories even as businesses reopened. This was reported for last week when Trump was bragging about the economy coming back. Apparently the stock market doesn’t buy it either.

@ GOP rhis needs to be disclosed. Man you guys really don’t give a shit about Americans. 1200 to feed a family for months. Not everyone got unemployment benefits. And now your government doesn’t think it’s necessary to disclose all the money the businesses got. https://twitter.com/clairecmc/status/1271799747767078913 …pic.twitter.com/K78NhG7Rlb
You mean a bunch of shitty jobs that have all disappeared. Now the highest unemployment rate for black people. Economic gap the largest in history.
My store is reopening tomorrow, and I was told I had "a choice." The choice? Return or they report you to the state unemployment that you refused work..
According to the latest figures from the US Labor Department (as of 14 May), 36.5 million American citizens have filed unemployment claims over the past eight weeks.
There are no words anymore. How in tf were they able to create a country within our country? Please tell me this makes them exempt from unemployment & foodstamps
Isn't the coronavirus/pandemic/lockdown/quarantine/government rules, the disincentive to work?? Unemployment benefits come out of every working person's paycheck. We've each paid for this. It's OUR ! Government decided to help (a tiny bit) by allowing the temporary increase.
First they’re not protesting because they’re getting unemployment they’re protesting due to the death of an unarmed black man. Ppl are stupid
We were talking about race relations. I’m not going back 50 years. First Step Act was a good move. Permanently funding HBCU was also. Lowering the unemployment rate and promoting US manufacturing can only help. I wish he would do more with the absurd murder rate in CHicago.
You can manipulate statistics by omitting factors in per capita welfare spending such as state budgets, median income, poverty rate, unemployment rate, income inequality ratio, etc. However, to get a more equitable figure, we look at GDP contribution.

Go live in Canada then. In January America unemployment rate 3.5%, everyone working, happy, blessed. Trade deal further . Shoot, 2.5% was coming! China changed things # COVID19. No sports hurt too Now @ POTUS cleaning up mess, making America great again. # BlackLivesMatter
The unemployment thing still got me smh
How do u think he got unemployment down to historic lows. He brought back manufacturing co's from China & other. He slapped tariffs on China. He just shut out Hauwei from 5G..could go on..he is giving incentives for american co's to leave China..etc..
I didn't mean to deflect from the jobs issue....but the population was smaller 40 years ago. And it took 40 years before unemployment got close to the lowest with a higher population. Hence more job creation than ever when you take population into consideration.
anything is possible under @ realDonaldTrump - record low black unemployment, opportunity zones, sentencing reform. it is democrat strongholds like Amy's # minneapolis - that black men die for no reason
There is ZERO news coming out of congress. WHAT ARE THEY DOING? Are they eligible for the extra $600 in unemployment?
Yes I realize each states unemployment differs. Please don’t try to educate me on unemployment. Don’t try that. :) Maybe if you did what I did you would see just how many abuse that system and hear from businesses that might have to close because they can’t get their workers

Instead of continuing your obsession with the Gov. of NY, why don't you instead focus your brilliance on your constituents who are STILL waiting for unemployment benefits due in large part to the system YOUR administration created. # ThankYou Senator!
It's actually costing them money to be in the minor leagues. Since they are getting these $400 checks they can't collect unemployment.
You have to pick one or the other. Do you want more COVID deaths or less unemployment? You can't criticize him for both. Lockdowns require more unemployment while less unemployment means no lockdowns.

Lead us? Where? Into more death? - more unemployment? or bankruptcy? Trump is incompetent. Worst president ever - by far.
Not you. And he’s directly encouraging continuing to re-open. That’s going to make it worse. Same thing happening in LA. They’re forcing reopenings to kick people off unemployment and killing people in the name of the economy. It’s disgusting.
Most people getting minimum wage get free health care too. The people that are hurting with medical care are generally people that make too much for free and too little to afford the cost of insurance, middle income level people. I was unemployed and my unemployment was $40 over

i finally get a job after 3 months of unemployment and i’m being repeatedly fucked over by my employer and my coworkers, probably making less money than i did last summer
People making more on unemployment says more about how poorly people are paid than anything else
To be fair, I think it would have helped had everyone gotten unemployment assistance or a bigger stimulus check.
Wow , thats insane. I live in l Massachusetts every november i get laid off from my job because i'm a swimming pool technician. So my job is considered seasonal. The longest it ever took for my unemployment was 2 weeks. Sounds like nevada needs to upgrade there ways.
Trump has nothing to do with fkorida unemployment systems so stupid its our leaders here stop it fake outlets

The same thing happened in 2008, you need to help businesses to avoid a further loss of jobs. It’s simple economic policy during a recession. And people still received unemployment benefits beyond the check, which is enough to live off of.
She’s been handed a better life in the unemployment line...
I am not going to vote if I don’t get my unemployment check
every two weeks I file for unemployment from a completely different and terrifying new world
Can they still receive unemployment if he has called them back and they refuse to come back?
What’s your excuse for his “leadership” when black unemployment was at its highest under him. Black on black crime was at its highest under him. And funding for historical black schools was at its lowest under him? There’s always an excuse for him so

Markets are volatile, opening down on Monday, unemployment is at a all time high. The expansion of America ended shortly after @ POTUS / @ realDonaldTrump took office and the @ GOP kept control of the senate. This will change in Nov hopefully and we will be on the path of goodness.

On Jan 15, 2020, the stock market hit an all-time high of 29,000. That same day, the Democrats delivered the "Articles Of Impeachment" to the Senate, and the first case of Covid-19 arrived in the US from China, setting the stage for the destruction of our Trump's booming economy.
A close below 3000 would concern some stock market bulls. Outside of the increase in cases in the US we’ve seen a rise in both Beijing and Tokyo reported with parts of Beijing back in lockdown now.

You're measuring velocity and supply in the hands of the stock market. I realize banks are still holding FED stimulus but there in lies the prob imo.We need to rewrite how we measure GDP and allow it to reflect on the our republic imo.

What type of investments are you speaking of? Stock market?
As stock market is going down soon... btc and crypto should follow?!
Increase taxes on stock investments! Stop stock buybacks that overinflate prices! And stop bailing out failing banks with $Trillions of Dollars$ of taxpayer money! We really don’t need the stock market.
Pension funds and retirement funds can invest in real assets of our country. The stock market is more of a liability than an asset. We need to end the corruption of Wall Street that only benefits the Rich!
Remember, most companies are privately held, and not publicly traded on the stock market. We don’t need the stock market.

Most start-up companies get private funding, and not a dime from the stock market when they start. Although there are some publicly traded Wall Street investment banks that have departments for start-up investment and loans.
I have something important to say. We could get rid of the stock market and still have investment. We could also switch government subsidies from fossil fuels to solar electricity, electric cars, battery technology, etc. Subsidies are a form of investment.

He doesn't care. If the stock market isn't hurting he thinks he's done a great job... even if it's the Fed buying all the stock to artificially keep the stock market afloat. What a fraud.
let's not act like he didn't claim credit for the good economy five minutes after he took office, then drove small farmers into bankruptcy, did nothing for the coal miners and ignored the virus until the stock market started to crash.
Love Robert Frost! In the stock market, the road less travelled is often more profitable. Once it gets crowded, leave.
There’s no way the stock market is not being artificially held up right now: pandemic , unemployment, recession, civil unrest. The stock market is doing way better than it should. Even with forward thinking, we have a resurgence of COVID coming during flu season.

If US GDP is 20 trillion dollars and a human life is valued at 10 million then the economy contracting by 10% is like losing 200k people ... is a statement some people seem to believe makes sense.

I think it will plateau. Look at GDP-per-capita — it’s at $2000. Even if it grows at 10% a year for another 20 years, it will be only $13,000 by year 2040. Still a developing nation. And the irrational democracy will elect more fascist leaders, who will ruin the economy

And yet in 1833 the UK used 40% of it’s GDP to pay towards the abolishment of slavery. A bill that has been part of our taxes until 2015. Any Brit in work before 2015 has actively paid toward ending slavery. Would you like to be held accountable for the sins of your fathers?
The US went from a colony to 50% of world GDP in about 150 years, which is pretty spectacular. Post-war japan economic growth has been about as fast as China's. And it does not look to me like China will catch up with Japan or Korea on a per capita basis in 10 years: pic.twitter.com/zo3zuzELWE

Warren Buffet believed the stock market was overvalued in 1999 because interest rates (then 6%) wouldn't go lower and corporate profits as a % of GDP (6%) couldn't go higher. Interest rates now zero and corporate profits/GDP hit 9% last year. https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/1999ar/FortuneMagazine.pdf …

America has a GDP of $23 trillion, easy to erect a border, we are in africa with a gdp of $370b, if anything, Africa need to be held accountable and fined by south africa. We deserve better. It shouldn't be our job alone to guard your people in our country
Under hyperbitcoinisation there will likely be a small deflationary aspect to bitcoin as your purchasing power increases 2-4% each year inline with growth in global GDP.

Bahi you reduce the spending your GDP further decline. Why can't you understand the economy and security are directly proportional. You cant increase your GDP without peace in the country. Lone PTM is enough to ruin your so called GDP. Have you forgotten Lal, Lal?
How much of total GDP goes to defence of Pakistan https://youtu.be/SL9wok39I4I
If senators were awarded according to federal tex contribution Arkansas would have 1 senator, it ranks no 27 in gross collection of federal taxes and no 35 in GDP. California would have 13 senators in comparison.
So what’s your expert take John If we add the -12% loss of GDP from a No Deal Brexit to the -20% of Covid would you say it was -32% or -29.6%? Which loss excites you more? You clearly are excited by the prospect of profiting from the UK’s destitution. But which excites you more?
From the ludicrous argument of NPP twitter, when there is an average of 6% YoY GDP growth, it’s reasonable infrastructure investment declines percentage-wise. When everything points that, at this stage of our economy there should be more and more commitment. BONKERS!!!
"The greatest country" is a really bas term to use considering how different each country is and the factors to consider. Different in what, GDP? SOL? Literacy rate? Military? https://twitter.com/AkilahObviously/status/1272025840927170561 …
Defence expenditure in terms of GDP is 2.6 %. This year Educational budget is 2.5 %. In Nawaz era education budget was only 0.6 %. Now buzz off PATWARI.
@ ScottWapnerCNBC @ davidfaber if the convention industry is worth 0.5% of GDP. Other business travel, training etc must be worth 1+%. Add in vacation travel and entertainment (ie concerts) and that must be 3+% of GDP. That plus Retail Closings plus Oil Industry cutbacks. Recession
Assumption? Why do you want to argue there’s been that GDP growth? What’s also wrong with spending even higher percentage on infrastructure regardless GDP growth. Or there’s been a peak in infrastructure investment. Bonkers.
Indonesia and China has increase in GDP??

The lockdown is this country’s biggest peacetime political mistake in a hundred+ years. Millions of jobs lost School kids not taught for months GDP crashed 20+ PST Cancer through the roof And all of it built on lies. WAKE UP EVERYONE. this virus is not as deadly as they said
I really don't see a problem with any of this. Every band has an vote for or against Then take the % of GDP revenue including spin off of all Oil and Gas and deduct that from those bands that don't want pipelines Then hold acc. the other bands that there will be no protests
Hope you understand that comparison bw countries are done not on amount but % of GDP. See what Forbes and World Bank say. Pakistan 4% of GDP and India just 2.4%. Pakistan actually spends highest in the region in % GDP pic.twitter.com/YPxSdd2HSQ

WA is one of the top states, year after year. It’s an amazing place. You know what states are never near the top? Red states. They don’t generate GDP, have to be subsidized, have terrible health data, and horrid education.
Simple maths In 2015 if 7 cedis was spent against 200 cedis GDP. That will be 3.5% In 2019 GDP increases from 200 cedis to 400 cedis. Do you know 12 cedis of that will be 3%? A lower percentage but a higher amount. You want to do agenda but wab)n. https://twitter.com/statsgh/status/1272257626231975939 …
Running a state agency in a state with one of the top 10 largest economies in the world and equal to Canada in size and GDP is the closest you’re going to get. And once again creating an agency is not equal to running it.
Champ, without accepting I’m the editor of the page, You and I know Ghana’s GDP YoY has not risen past 10% in a long while. So when we taking under 5% commitments to infrastructure, you can’t argue on lines of, there’s been a higher rise of GDP so there’s enough
The 20% fall in GDP has probably scared him shitless. I highly doubt there will be another lockdown.

The economy of hong Kong in terms of GDP cannot be compared with Nigeria in terms of GDP even Egypt is healthy cannot be compared with some countries in Asia just Google. Africa is changing
The entire federal budget 2018 was $4.4 trillion. U.S. GDP ~$21 Trillion. So $93 trillion is diverting 100% of ALL federal spending for about 20 years? Lying sacks of shit that spread this crap and the morons that believe it - which are worse?
It's quite obvious that a) You didn't do very well at school and b) You still live with your mum I mean, you think that the USA (GDP $20.5 trn) and China (GDP $13.6trn) are going to give the UK (GDP $2.85trn) equitable FTAs. Seriously, how gullible are you??
I think about 3% of GDP at this point. Probably going to 20% if I have my way in shrinking the GDP. But this will eliminate poverty.
Obviously since the GDP is 2/3 consumer spending, if people have more money to spend, it is actually good for this economic structure that we have designed. So how does it hurt everyone else if we give the Pentagon a little less money and instead use it for something good?
Economy, education, foreign policy in disarray.Moving close to Turkey than annoying them by supporting Saudis.Sidelining China now moving closer to them. GDP at historical low with negative growth,lowest ever budget for higher education. No pride, no dignity only humiliation.
Workers share of GDP has significantly declined since the 70s and was substantially better when unions were strong and plentiful in the 50s and 60s. A family living comfortably on a single income, seems like a forgotten dream. pic.twitter.com/EO5B58DQwL
