KayBarbie is drunk and disorderly. Trump is the worst president in history. He is so far below the real President Obama and they can't accept that the "growing economy" was initiated and made strong by Pres. Obama's admin. and they are ruining it. @ PressSec
Houses of worship & faith-based organizations that promote religious beliefs aren’t usually eligible for money from the U.S. Small Business Administration. But as the economy plummeted & jobless rates soared, Congress let faith groups tap into the Paycheck Protection Program.
I think eventually the economic reality of fighting this virus by shutting down the economy will hit our leadership like a freight train. We will end up doing what Sweden did 6-12 months too late and just open up. You can't save lives if you have no money left for healthcare.
It's multiples more contagious is what makes it worse than the typical flu. It attacks different populations differently. I'm 65, overweight & with co-morbidities. I'm quite cautious. That said, I'm a big open the economy and schools advocate for those unlike me. Let it fly!
You are playing right into Trump’s us v. them. We’re all Americans. Yeah, we have differences, but above all else, we’re Americans. And the country is getting ripped apart, with the economy a wreck, as he tries to find and keep votes.
The economy works just fine, thanks. My family came here to get away from the type of economy you support.
You haven't been able to stabilize the economy through good times. You cant budget. You are the worst thing for Canada right now.

The last two things are out of his control. No person could stop that. 4.8 million jobs added back in June. We are on the climb! By great, I mean great. Best economy ever before the Wuhan Flu hit. Not a tax monger like the democRATS. Like I said, there is no other choice.

Do you know how ignorant you sound? You feed off the media....! You are arguing about death rate AND quarantine?!? Yet...saying Abbott screwed up? Pick one!!!!!!!!!! A 14 day quarantine is WAY better than shutting down the economy! And other than that, death rate!!!
Exactly. Economy before lives. But surely medium term it will effect economy with loss of life and jobs through method used. It’s all very fucking bizarre to me. Very very much so
Then he should get the fuck out of the way before children are sickened or worse as sacrifices to the god of the economy.
The tax cuts launched a stagnant economy that only looked good on fake graphs designed yo create the illusion the Obama economy was good. Trumps done more to lower drug prices than any POTUS in your lifetime.

How do you come to these conclusions? Is it just because you do not like the man on a personal level or do you believe in socialism? This pandemic is not his fault. He had the economy going in the best direction before the outbreak.
I think you are right. Fewer, and the high-end will either have to come down or be very expensive (never more than half full, etc). But once there is a vaccine after 1 year things will come back if rest of economy hasn't collapsed..

Never again should we listen to the government, the @ CDCgov or the @ who and allow them to shutdown our economy, put healthy people in a quarantine for months on end or comply w/ridiculous orders. It's just two weeks they said, we just need to flatten the curve they said.
Don't care about all this fakery....just open up the economy, cancel the emergency BS, remove all the stupid rules about 2 meters, masks, of which no scientific data exists to support this. Be a leader, not a dictator!
It's crazy. There's zero way our economy can restart smoothly without the virus in a utter chokehold. Ex. Our local schools are making plans to do A/B student attendance. How do ANY parents in unremoteable jobs do childcare?

Hopefully that's all that is at play. But I'm skeptical. Even before the quarantines, the economy was well overdue for a cycle of contraction. And momentum is a part of what keeps the economy moving; that momentum has been well and truly disrupted.

While I am a proponent of the free market and capitalism as a whole. A winner takes all economy where the top winners have no accountability and no regard for the human condition becomes a bit worrying. I won't say "eat the rich", but I will say tax the rich.
The ghost of Joe McCarthy has entered the building ladies and gentlemen. Seriously, the "marxist" crap went out the window decades ago. Obama was a "marxist" and the economy and stock market was way ahead of "capitalist" Bush, at the end of his presidency.

But that standard is so low that it doesn't actually measures poverty, it measures how a society transitions from a non-monetary economy to a monetary one. A real measure of extreme poverty would probably be around 10 2011 dollars PPP per day.

Immigration, illegal and legal, is a NET positive to our economy. Go find one economist who disagrees with that statement. Not even the staunchest critics of immigration will say that immigration is a NET negative on our economy.
And btw, when India's economy becomes as big as China's (relative to US), the US-India relationship will get pretty challenging too. Democracies fight as well. US-China is just further ostensibly complicated by ideology.

I just don't understand any of this. Even as moronic as the administration is they have to understand even the economy is not going to recover until they control the virus & to do that they have to follow guidelines & listen to science. I worry we will get to a point of no return
Not necessarily. The economy could have been shut down sooner for a shorter period of time. A lot of jobs and lives could have been saved. However some idiots felt a reality TV guy who is a serial adulterer and filed for bankruptcy 6 times should lead us.

Get your head out of your ass and get a handle on the virus. You cannot stimulate the economy with no stimulus; people can't work if there is a virus; kids can't go to school if there is a virus. People are dying and we can't get ONE test, let alone one every damn day!

Soviets couldn't keep their economy going because they spent too much time throwing up after looking at American cookbooks
I’m afraid that we may see by November. Since politicians have no spine for a real shutdown, the math on the virus is pretty clear. The economy cannot recover until the virus is under control. Apparently, those who don’t want to wear a mask actually do want economic collapse.
“Stupid economy” Spoken like a true Leftist A healthy economy preserves lives & increases quality of life. No children are dying of this illness. Grandparents can also die of seasonal flu. Your logic has masks on & schools shut down 4ever because there’s always going 2B something

After 911 the economy went in the tank. What did W. do? Send us , stimulus package. Housing market tanks. What did Obama do? Didn't involve direct payments, but stimulus package. The virus hits. What did Trump do? Stimulus package. Before each one we were supposedly broke
There's a pandemic raging, taxpayers are being robbed so that the rich can become even more wealthy, & now arrogant politicians want to kill children (a desperate ploy to try & patch up the economy THEY destroyed). There is nothing you can do that will redeem any of you.

Half-way measures have been getting half-way results. Economy would be better (more repoenings), schools would reopen without drama. Look at Europe and much of Asia. But no, because discipline and responsibility are too hard. 3/3
Oh look it’s Cortez costing the economy more job losses.
Economics. More people need to learn it in school. I'm very liberal and want income equality as much as anyone else but the answer isn't to cripple sectors of the economy. The ripple effects of those policies affect all of us.

It's an article that fact-checks Hayes on his claim how important foreign students are to the U.S. economy. The U.S. has the most foreign students of all countries who all spent money while living there. You want them out, but claim it doesn't ruin anything, which is Illogical.

They are not covering up anything. Neither is Canada. The difference is that we are not ignorant like Americans who politicize everything. They know how to socially distance and practice it very well. Even without a lock down their economy has suffered

Exactly. If people did this right, in moderation, wear masks, only go where you really need to, we could all function with less fear and less strain on the economy. Just following the guidelines would save lives. Stay safe and well.

instead of, "we can't stop the economy" try, "the gov't should pay people a living wage to incentivize staying home in order to protect the lives of human beings and ensure all of us have access to food, water, electricity, healthcare, and other social goods"
Yes, there are always risks, even with masks. In prisons, they cannot social distance. What I do not understand is why refusing such a simple thing as a mask, when it can help your fellow countrymen, the health workers, and the economy, in short the country? Why?
Like how the Trump Cult go along that Trump is the Baby Jesus and everyone else is corrupt and communist and destroying American. MAGA MAGA Bing Bong - Only Trump can Save Us - 15 going magically to zero, I have cured us of Coronavirus - the economy is awesome.

“In this economy?” Is a great excuse to get out of doing things! “Can you take the car and get it washed tomorrow?” Me - In this economy? “Wanna have sex tonight?” Her - In this economy?
Yeah idk how economically conservative you can realistically be without the attending baggage. The economy isn't this thing independent on peoples' behavior, it's reflective of it. Generally when you want to cut back on social welfare, it comes with a fuck you I got mine outlook.
Japan has airports and is a major player in the global economy. It has a 126 million people. Given its size, it is far denser. Population density plays a major role in this. Which is why you see people from rural areas take it less serious than metropolitan areas.
Well, now I assume we're getting into the ban on immigration on some middle eastern countries and parts of Africa. I personally think it had more to do with not taking in so many refugees from Syria and other war-torn areas, that might adversely affect our economy.
Simple: Roads help commerce Commerce helps the economy The economy helps everyday people feel comfortable with their gov't. I'd think it's a stretch, except for all the people wanting us to move to socialism.
Support @ GoyaFoods if you love America, these marxist trolls wanting to slow down the economy to hurt Trump!
Sorry your right let’s shut everything down completely destroy the economy for a virus with almost a 100% survival rate!!!!!
In order to have a safe and stable world economy, it first needs a gigantic correction. This is because of the credit bubble that started in the 1970s and has never faced correction. We are just delaying and exacerbating the eventual collapse that is to come.
Agreed. His base is his base and Covid only enhanced TDS. But I think voters in swing states are the ones most affected by the economy. The worse America is doing heading into the election, the happier Dems are.. if removing Trump is the only goal.

Incorrect. A Socialist Economic system is THE MOST Democratic system of Economics. What you are describing is a Command Economy such as the USSR instituted with centralized governmental planning, which will typically fail and collapse. The USSR did not have a Socialist Economy.
The American people united in one voice against Trump failed policies, racial +social divide, the toxic atmosphere he's created, failed economy, and incompetence in managing the government and now the pandemic crisis... Those are the American people's talking points! # VoteHimOut
Leading the world in covid-19 infections and deaths with no end in sight! Winning the Trump way! Too bad his economy was so fragile it tanked due to his failure with Covid. Obama's economy never tanked and he had Zika, Ebola and H1N1 and we thrived and he lowered the deficit too.

It’s both! And I think the distinction between the two is artificial. We can’t have a strong economy without strong social infrastructure.
Manufacturers directly contribute to the economy via taxes and employment. Teachers cost the taxpayer more than they're worth while leeching taxes from the provincial coffers.
Thought experiment: If we declared an entire state racist-friendly...making bigotry absolutely LEGAL: a) What would be the predominate race in that state? b) Which political party would carry that state? c) Without federal intervention, what would that economy look like?
An example that always stuck out for me was in the video game Far Cry 4 One of the factions has a leader that's right on everything: ending colonialism, liberating women, public ownership of the economy, etc. But to make her "morally ambiguous" she's pro-narco state for no reason
That’s not what half of the country wants. They want to ruin the economy and kill people. Maybe next time around...

I'd say most professions don't really need any type of out-of-job training. Employers basically have to teach and reteach people to make them practical for our specialized economy.
1/2: I don’t think you really know how our economy works. It’s not just rich people acting as parasites on lower class. You don’t have a complete and honest view of how things work. This is how it works. Not a version of capitalism I agree with, but better than Marxism:

Goodoh. So our credit rating will inevitably go down as others take our place by your own logic. The UK is the 21st most populous nation in the world., So by your logic we will end up as the 21st largest economy in the world. Glad we got that sorted.
Research showed 40% of Californian students never opened a single zoom class since March. We’re screwing the next generation over a virus that for kids under 10 is less deadly than the flu, which has a vaccine. Let’s not destroy the economy and kids lives over partisan positions.
At the peak of the virus in March and April there was no mask mandate. The death rate and the cases have been coming down ever since. You’re relocking down our economy in your masks aren’t doing a damn thing except allowing you to virtue signal.

Rebuild the economy he destroyed. Mexico might just pay for that wall right about now
Trump will not bring the economy back, he’s destroyed our democracy & has ignored the virus. Let him send his grandkids back to public school first, he’s incompetent & in dereliction of duty what he’s done to our Country is horrendous. Vote Biden
Not even that man. Trump himself destroyed-or at least helped--to destroy the economy by shutting down the whole country
So to help out the economy we probably need to take check our sofa cushions and car seats.
Maybe we can rescue the economy in 2021 by having a REALLY big DOJ. Full employment!

I believe that's wishful thinking tbh. But it's totally possible I think Americans will vote for law and order and a booming economy. I'm pretty sure Trump is the law and order candidate. The Democrats encourage lawlessness and disorder when politically convenient
Because there are plenty that can go back to work but won’t whilst they’ve got the luxury of furlough. So he’s right to tell them to get back to work. The economy needs rebuilding sooner rather than later.
7) Of course, beyond global agenda- we have an active coup in our nation. All of this provides plenty of motive for collapsing our economy, as per the "squad" has blabbed, and keeping our nation in perpetual abusive chaos, borne of tyranny and ignorance. No, I will not be silent!
It is so heartbreaking that the franchise of abscbn has been denied and it's a big loss to our economy, putting our country on downside. Not wise enough and always seeking problem not resolution.

No, but it's getting in his way. They did a segment today that He's feeling sorry for himself he is once again a victim. Because of the covert the racial protests & the economy. Poor Donnie, aww @ realDonaldTrump
Not true. He inherited the highs from the 2 terms of president Obama. The economy isn't to be confused with the stock indexes. The stock market impacts a small % of people (mainly those invested in stocks). The economy impacts everyone and right now under Trump it's in shambles.

We’re working hard to ensure all claimants are paid the benefits they’re eligible to receive. Hundreds of new staff have completed training, and are processing claims or on the phone lines to assist with the unemployment program.
Its better then the millions trump has on unemployment and without healthcare. GOP are bankrupting Americans and stealing from the small business loans to give to themselves.
Unless i read the article incorrectly, they are trying to make it so you are paid 100%, instead of a flat $600. I think that’s far, & helps those not making their full salary on unemployment, currently there are a lot who are making more. I know a few people making more

We have all seen Trump lead the country... Look at where we are... Record Unemployment, Pandemic killing Americans, People losing their homes, jobs, etc. On the verge of a recession.. This is all because of Trump. Anybody can do better.
If the senate republicans don't extend the pandemic unemployment assistance they're trying to lose. 33 MILLION Americans are about to have their only source of income reduced by 2/3 while more and more places shut down. I'm just so fucking black pilled.

Are you telling me that you are unable to collect unemployment? Where do you live? I never heard of such a thing. And if you're unemployed you shouldn't be paying any taxes, certainly not the highest taxes.
??? maybe you should be focusing on fixing the unemployment system, making a mask mandate, and also stop reopening the state and killing floridians???? just a thought
Everyone was smoking zaza eating crab legs and doing mountains of cocaine that unemployment bouta be up they bouta be back paycheck to paycheck again
don’t extend unemployment until dec, make these niggas go back to work
But like I said there's no need to flex your money. There's people (like me) who still have to go to work full time during the pandemic and don't get nearly enough, compare to someone staying at home, doing nothing, and getting the unemployment just to flex it ... Like come on
Exactly just because Democrats say they are the party of working class doesn't prove it their record does not prove it. What is Trump's record does prove he's for the people no matter what color. Lowest unemployment, average pay going up, and now he signed a bill helping Latinos

It's not what you know, it's who you know. It has always been that way. Back in the late 70s and early 80s we paid an unemployment insurance tax and when you were laid off you had to fight tooth and nail to get it. They treated you like it came out of their personal pockets.
I have a few suggestions. For those that replace human jobs, I'd go with "an unemployment of robots".

I’ll spend $500 in unemployment $1s just bc there’s a coin shortage
That is the best you can do. It enrages me the R governors who do nothing to protect people who must work on site, have jobs not possible to work online. All “open state up” does is prevent vulnerable from getting unemployment & risk more CV spread.
Another one? Didn’t watch because hate is ugly but haven’t they learned yet!? Another unemployment claim.
You think wearing a face mask is reasonable I don’t let’s leave it at that. I was down my town today and it was deserted the shops were empty u probably think this is a good thing I realise it will just add to the mass unemployment we’re to face.

When unemployment is close to back to normal, drop it to $0/week. But the two extremes of $300/week unemployment and $900/week unemployment are both equally crazy.

Not. That ends at the end of this month and when you get fired you don’t automatically get unemployment. The employer can reject your claim especially if it was for insubordinate behavior.
leadership here is more science based & they worked bipartisan from the start. Unemployment benefits doubled, stimulus cheques, employee pay guaranteed, forced closures, sanitizer at all shops, markers on the ground where you can line up to pay, store customer limits and 1/2

Oh ya I get that part for sure! I just think it's unfair people are talking so much shit about it, like if you're that mad quit your job and get unemployment too lol - kidding. But the extra $600/wk ends in like 2 weeks anyways so a lot of people will have like no money at all
My goal is to have all the basic furniture and household stuff a normal person acquires from family members/wedding registries/over time, by the time the bonus unemployment runs out using government money to play 15 years of catch-up
Yes. But they don't pay taxes. The employees laid off/furloughed would get the unemployment plus stimulus bonus (what was it, 600 weekly). That's how the gov't takes care of employees. But churches don't pay taxes like businesses. And church folks can do church stuff AT HOME.
Mr trump how will I make sure my son gets there if we are too sick to make it until then. If you haven’t looked at the numbers the south is on fire with fever right now. We are sick sir. My son and husband have been laid off a second time and no unemployment.

I wonder if it was the pre Covid booming economy, or the low across the board unemployment rates and the confidence Trump can do it again???
You’re struggling. I suggest you stand down. unemployment continued to drop after Trump was elected, but it did so at a slightly slower rate.

You realize you just stated two opposing ideas, more restrictions = more unemployment, maybe less people die, less restrictions = more die and still more unemployment. How exactly would you have handled things? Free passes to governors too? Or just the blue ones?
My unemployment benefits were $319/week + $600/week. Tips were pooled so I know my coworkers will be making $319/week too. And they have to pay $2000-$3000/month for their rent. With $1276/month of unemployment income, due to no fault of their own lol
That’s because @ SenRickScott purposefully commissioned a faulty unemployment website and Floridians are paying the price.
Welp now that unemployment is going down, I’m glad I got all my necessities
@ SpeakerPelosi We need economic aid. I am not for free handouts but this is a special circumstance. Please consider monthly stimulus payments until we get out of this. For unemployment if we can't get the extra $600 could we atleast get the pay we would get at our job?

What area of work are you in? Do you have kids? Most Albertans I chat with I find some common ground with. I opt to dialogue & not attack/argue. I care our unemployment #s are sky high. I care our deaths by suicide rates are horrifically high.
I wonder if there is anything left in the unemployment account. We know how our state spends money and allocates it. Maybe they predict every year a certain amount of unemployed and then allocate what they think is surplus ( when it is not) to something else.
Unemployment rate is waiving
Catholic here & my husband works for a Catholic Church in one of the largest parishes in Louisiana. Even though masses were cancelled he & the rest of the employees worked the entire time. Good thing too. Church doesn’t pay unemployment taxes so none of them qualified if laid off
Meh. Mixed feelings. I have 20+ $22/hour positions available and no one wants them..... unemployment is easier. Offered some employment for tenants who wanted “reductions” and got resounding “no’s”. Tough to justify if they don’t wanna work.
It's complicated, but you can restart unemployment benefits if you're laid off again http://dlvr.it/RbNJ6K pic.twitter.com/SSTQI7aR94

Start Applying for Unemployment Lady G. # LindseyMustGo
We are being accused of enjoying our unemployment benefits too much. I think the better question is WHY am I making more of unemployment than I was working FULL time at the local school...with a master's degree...
Idk if it’s like this where you are but here the unemployment is based on your income PLUS the $600. So mostly everyone is making more than they were before. And they’re unemployed so they don’t need childcare. Then there’s people that are working still, not getting any kind of
I know!!! But smells like unemployment extending to me which i am grateful for

One question: do all of these exposed racists go apply for unemployment? They have to put terminated, but how do they explain their way out of that situation? Honestly, why should decent, hardworking people (like the ones being harassed) have to support them? Insult to injury.

Honestly the only good thing he has done that has benefited me was to screw up this whole COVID mess because it allowed me to collect unemployment and make more money. Which is obviously really shitty b/c people have died but that was my saving grace financially

they gonna end unemployment while so many Americans couldn’t even access the websites to be able to get unemployment in the first place + all the phone lines were down for months in Florida. ridiculous
Nobody actually enjoys being at home and being on unemployment. So over people whining about it you'd be thankful if you were having to be on it, go be bitter somewhere else
Someone on fb was ranting about how people are still getting the $600 a week if they're on unemployment and how they should get jobs instead. Like.... 1) $2400 a month when you're unemployed isn't shit 2) we're in the middle of a pandemic & not everywhere is open or hiring
This will see sharp down days followed by days where it looks like it might recover. The reality will be a slow and steady down-trend similar to what we saw with the recession. New events, like unemployment running out, people defaulting on homes, etc. will continue this.

Since it’s creation, the stock market has bounced back 100% of the time. And always remember: when sitting in the bank, your money is losing value due to inflation. So at a minimum, invest in the S&P and make 6% on your money.
All the rest of us could die, but as long as the 1% can still watch the Stock Market rise & fall, they won’t care. Life is irrelevant. They worship money.

The world needs to comprehend that humans through their birth certificates were incorporated. Meaning the birth certificate is a corporate identity, linked to trust accounts, the certificate is also used to trade on stock markets while living and dead. Attornies are complicit.

I think our country has been entering into the Dark Ages all over again. Since this current administration got in, gaslighting has ruled the day in everything from government to the stock market. The premium we once put on truth and rationality and integrity is no more.
Yes it is the wayfair stock.. and I’m sure it’s much worse now becausr the the stock market closed.. I’m guessing it won’t look pretty in the morning.
I cannot believe that they become that rich by giving money to a carnival barker like Trump. They already received their cash cows in his tax cuts and his stock market manipulation. Hopefully it has the same turnout as TULSA, surely money being flushed.

Probably depends on which monkey,I’m sure some did better, and some probably did worse. If there was no FED intervention, I’m pretty sure the monkey would do better. I know absolutely nothing about the stock market, and I have made way over 200% in the last 6 months. Thanks FED.

Direct payments to the low income, normally just get distributed in the economy and then economic multiplication takes place as the monies move through the economy rather than into the stock market. Most positive impact.

Oh yes of course. Current market cap would be completely out of the question. But being a solid, reputable, high-end car maker was at some point an option for them. Unfortunately, Elon decided that pumping the stock and giving himself option bonuses was more important than that.
So you test and protect the vulnerable while the masses should be staying away from the elderly or vice-versa. Well when you have the elites, media and Dems shutting things down, how can the small business survive? I guess it’s not essential to earn a living under PC Covid rules
A corrupt businessman has no business deciding or commenting on when schools should open. I'm sick of this business modeling.

I just want to make sure I get this straight. Burning down your city, ripping down Historical Statues, closing down small business owners, forcing masks on healthy folks & shutting down your local city counsel is all considered progressive?? Did I miss something here?

I’m also not against shutting business down for a week if they’re found to be in violation of rules.
You understand the longer businesses are shut down the more likely they and the economy will never recover right ? I mean you don’t own a business and shutting everything down doesn’t affect you in the least, but you can probably comprehend how it hurts us business owners...

How about you handle tyrannical # WhitmoretheTyrant and her mask forcing , school closing self. What she us doing is unconstitutional and down right illegal. Fining people 500$ for no mask, shutting down small business. Socialism in Michigan
Let me understand this: Shutting down a person's business because they have said something you disagree with (thus silencing others with the same view) is freedom of speech?

if you even think about shutting any businesses down you will have killed every Kentucky there's no need to shut any business down we should open every business up this is not a deadly virus as one thought I still don't know anyone who's had it all you are is an evil dictator
How about just shutting down protests that disrupt local business, block traffic, and harass residents. I support everyone's right to protest but that right should not interfere with everyone else's right to peacefully enjoy and live their lives.
Much needed policies!!! Opening the country up for business under the risk of COVID is better than shutting the doors and dying from depression or drug-overdose.
Perhaps shutting down every small business completely and only leaving up massive corporations for several months wasn’t the best idea. Screwed over all the small business owners and now the rich are much richer
Thank you for keeping it real for those who need to understand, this is a pandemic that isn’t shutting down business but families.
most western countries have shut down business with the usa till trump is gone. now there shutting down there borders to keep americans out because of trump. Trudeau doesn't even show up and they have canceled the g7 because of trump and crew. vote him out save your country.
Does shutting down your business mean you lose your home? WELL THAT'S JUST YOU BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE. What if we target your wife? Why isn't she fair game? She married a bigot/monster/whatever we decide to call you.
Oh look. Everyone knows where a person is what he has & he ain't talking like before coronavirus everything was good & damn well. Obvious know nothing about business. Sure says a hell of alot about shutting down. 2 lane roads state wide! $5.00 flat rate gas price. @ WhiteHouse
The Ford gov't was just beginning to earn some degree of trust from the REC business community--& working hard, w/ supercharged AGCO blasting out RSAs all spring. Shutting REC retailers out in a monopoly that serves no practical public health purpose will torch that trust.

Sports and schools will try to open but will end up shutting down. Read th e article in the LA times about the fom business. This pandemic is drastically hurting many and all industries
We are debating stay at home orders and shutting down business, not social distancing measures.
Stupidity was in shutting down states too late, and reopening too soon. Then so many people act as if everything is "business as usual" after states reopen. Ducey COULD have prevented the catastrophe in Arizona. Could do the right thing now. Two words: mandatory masks.
Did u think shutting down business was Nigeria idea? It was a policy copied from overseas bruh.... Everything is a copied system Not fully Nigeria idea....
that's called unracism, right? i hope "actively shutting it down" means using your voice to condemn it and refusing to do business with said racist and ends there. the issue with politicians joining in this chorus is that most people assume that person will support legislation.

Shutting down any state is not an option. Taking precautions like hand washing and possibly masks are. Keep shutting down a business or ordering citizens to stay indoors is a totalitarian system and basically, a DIM move to shut down our economy and stop Trump . Flu is Flu.
yoooo if you're an influencer who feels the need to infiltrate ed twitter & expose vulnerable people just venting about their experiences, try shutting the fuck up and minding your own business first
Yaz i feel like alot of companies will be forced to change their business model and how they operate after this. So many businesses are just shutting down just like that

Normalize shutting the hell up about things that ain’t ya business.
shutting down sounds like a warning to everyone "we can shut down the bigest one what more the small ones" it's still business at the end of the day, others will be cautious now and safeguard their company. and i don't know if we will still get the real news after this.
We might be next because small business where I live are shutting down

Completely agree, Gonzalo. The PPP funneled through business entities to employees so they could pay their rent and feed their kids, and shutting down church services undoubtedly harmed the church’s ability to make payroll. We shouldn’t be angry employees were paid.
What is the point of a boycott other than shutting down a business, which is ruining his life and taking jobs from his employees. And what inhumane policies are you taking about? Obama’s policy of separating kids from adults? The mental gymnastics of the left are amazing.
and compared to shutting business down, masks r about the least onerous burden possible

Though her employer, LBrands, is shutting down 100’s of stores in an attempt to reduce losses, this manager is further limiting the company’s business potential by alienating customers. Stupid business plan.
No there actually isn’t. There is a virus that is real but not deadly enough to shut down the entire country. Precautions can be taken without shutting down business. Get your head out of the mud
To clarify, I say COVID is shutting it down because even when in Green in PA, business activity among my and all my friends businesses were materially down because consumers are concerned for their safety. Testing, tracing and isolation would fix that. Ask businesses.
Nothing stop your company from shutting down here in SA and open in Zimbabwe or DRC etc. Oh no, your company wont because the environment is not business friendly. Your company wants to enjoy our friendly laws and infrastructure BUT hire foreigners. Don’t try to blackmail us!
4. How many minority jobs or livelyhoods are impacted by putting people out of business? 5. What is the national psychological impact of shutting down common sense? 6. How many such people are now self indoctrinating themselves by visiting far right places on the internet?
In this time of pandemic when people are losing their jobs, business shutting down and the economy is on the verge of collapse, the decision shutting down rhe abs cbn is very inhumane, absolutely out of sense and timing.

He thinks like a scientis. the economy needs to continue be open keeping them closed does not help the working class. Bafoons like Hollywood can afford to have the economy shut down but I dont see the Hollywood industry shutting down or the CA governors wine business shut down.

Just one of many complications from shutting down our entire society, hope the elites are happy that they were able to capitalize on the pandemic (and shutdowns) to only consolidate more wealth and power while small business closures ravage the country
This is not a good time to look for a job. When every business is either scaling down or even shutting down due to Pandemic. Opportunities not much these days.
People die from viruses. Always have, always will. Shutting down the entire economy is not a solution unless you are willing to destroy small business & the middle class irreparably. Let’s stop pretending the government cares about loss of life
If u had cancer like me & husband do & ur wbc hung in at 2, u had kids that went to school u might think shutting in unempaths that won't wear masks an alternative. Keep business open for ppl that want to protect us. I don't wanna die from covid after cancer
location, (country, state, etc) with the HIGHEST numbers of cases and deaths at the moment... I agree with actually shutting down all non-essential business. Even 50% capacity is too much in my eyes. But this is my personal opinion. As much as I’d LOVE for my life to go back

200 cases is not worth shutting the country down. Japan has handled this as well as anyone.
He didn't either. He called shutting down the border to China xenophobic. I don't even know if he'd have shut down border w/ Europe. He said nothing as Dem officials told ppl to go about their business until early March. Even Fauci said that in late Feb.

Shutting a network down won't insulate media from political and business interests. It will make it more vulnerable. We need more voices, not fewer.
Shutting down business and travel in January would’ve been impossible with the limited info that was coming out of China at the time. The economic repercussions that happened in March appeared more dangerous than the virus based on its projections due to false Chinese numbers

the free market doesn't break monopolies though. in order to have a truly free market, you need regulation to keep big business from crushing competition and taking market share. think of walmart taking over most of local market economies and shutting down tons of small business.

You brought it up. Wearing a mask does absolutely nothing to harm anyone or anything. You are placing so much emphasis on it for what reason? Its not the cause of shutting down the country. Its not the cause of any political anything. Just wear it and return to business as usual.

What does any political have to gain from shutting the economy down? Neoliberal Democrats’ beliefs are opposed to this. Their role in state and city govt is to court business interests, just like Republicans. What do they have to gain from shutdowns?
# firefauci this opening and shutting of the economy is ridiculous and an easy answer. It would be like saying you need safe sex. You can just get an abortion. Meaning, there are some very simple measures people can take. Without bankrupting people and business.
March had every politician globally inducing fear from an unknown virus and telling the entire world to stay inside and shutting down business. It was system breaking fear. I think we need similar to crash,like a currency failing. Or sign the fed is losing control of debt prices.
Same goes for business owners in college towns. Shutting down college football is 100x worse than playing through it and dealing with the virus.

UK has a sovereign currency so used quantitative easing at over 10 times the value of Ireland's "bail out" from the European central bank Quantitative easing.what do you make of Ireland's gdp per capita being twice the uk Oh no you don't answer questions do you?
To your original point, Canada nowhere near a cause for concern at 50% debt/GDP. Kind of ridiculous to be worried about it here especially given how low rates are.
GDP is one of the metrics we still do better on
You’re right that since others buy treasuries doesn’t make the US (or any country) less indebted. However the reserve status is a privilege that allows that country to theoretically have a higher potential maximum debt/gdp threshold. Admittedly that’s theoretical / untested
I wonder how much value creation is happening that’s not being counted in GDP given the number of free services out there. We don’t pay for google gmail, we don’t pay to use social media - if we did then I’d have to think how much that would change GDP.
Are you a business person or just a critic... which country develops without debt of any sort... debt is what drives international capital and projects thereof... the US alone has debt of 120% of GDP, Japan over 200%...
Yes all nations have debt. The percentage of debt to their budgets and gdp will give a clearer picture

So Congress has spent $3+ trillion so far for corona relief. The Fed bought up another $3 trillion worth of corporate bonds. That's nearly 1/3 of US GDP. We could have just shut everything down for 2-3 months, crushed the virus, kept all jobs, and still spent less. Am I wrong?

output +consumption of consumer goods are integral to a country’s economic system that relies on GDP growth, it doesnt matter what type of good its producing. the allocation of scarce resources doesnt prioritize the creation of certain goods over others. rich ppl r prioritized

So larger population=higher GDP by your statement. Growing economies will have currencies that investors want to invest in. The UK economy will not be one of them (or at least will be decreasingly desirable). We seem to be in agreement at last.
No we're not. Canada has the second highest credit rating in the world. We have a very serviceable debt to GDP ratio.
Lol you keep telling yourself that but not only do you personally pay more but the USA pays nearly twice as much from the GDP on health care as other developed nations.
It’s manufacturing money. It employs people who then produce more GDP. Cost: negative (more stuff gets produced).
I see. So you accept that the UK with 65 million population will slide down the GDP table then inevitably with such a small population? If so, how can you explain how our credit rating will hold up?

That’s why Obamacare was dipping our toes in the water for this shit, and look the damage it did.. lowest economic recovery in American history, jobs gone to China, sinking gdp

We just hit a trillion dollar debt. Relative to GDP and population, we have more debt per capita than you do! And he shut down the western oil fields of course. We have some of the biggest oils fields in the world yet to be touched. Oh well... rusty windmills I guess.

Easy answer, Japan must have GDP growth, always. If the renewables can’t deliver, then they abandon greenwashing rhetoric and go back to trustworthy fossil fuels.

You’re nuts! A Biden win would be a disaster for the economy. He has promised to roll back the Trump tax cut which would immediately cut 1% from GDP and put us in a deep recession. Be honest and have the guts to stand up for the truth!
“That was quite low in historic terms for Aust & relative to comparable countries. In ALP’s last full year, 2012-13, spending was cut to $367 billion — 23.9% of GDP. Abandoning all promises, the incoming Coalition with Cormann as finance minister swiftly reversed this thrift.”
I think you know it’s more than trump “shaking hands” with dictators. He has quite the affinity for them. And the economy was nothing spectacular before the pandemic. A debt (conservative??) fueled tax cut artificially juiced the stock market. Earnings and gdp were nothing great

Equating the vote to the GDP of each state is absurd. Are we going to equate each States value to their tax base and how much their residents contribute or take from the Country? hate that some states continually take more than they pay, but the state needs fair representation.

Well spotted! Over 50% of the 750m increase in global population by 2030 will be in the Perennials 55+ generation.They already own most of what they need, and their incomes decline as they enter retirement. So there is no way global GDP can rise enough to pay off today's debt...
