@ JackBrewerBSI Anybody can get a job when the economy is great. What matters is that of 194 judicial appointments to the Federal bench only 7 African Americans nominated but only 5 of them confirmed. God's not a Racist unlike Trump.
The most important skills in the innovation economy r critical thinking (about problems, situations, markets etc) & the ability to communicate (an idea, a recommendation etc) in a way that is not only thoughtful & compelling but also in a way that influence others to take action
I dont think he has ever held a real job, and certainly hasn't created any jobs, at least not private sector jobs. The support for him and his socialist agenda in light of the strong economy and plentiful opportunities is puzzling to me.
The economy was already on the rise from Obama. Same for minority employment.
They stimulate our economy, they put food on our table as I’ve yet to see whitey out there picking in 100 degree heat. White ppl steal SS numbers and draw in more disability and welfare than immigrants. Immigrants are hardest working ppl I know.
Well I’m currently in university but my story doesn’t matter. I don’t question that the economy has improved and Trump isn’t all bad. However I believe that Bloomberg is a good moderate candidate compared to Trump and Bernie. I don’t see Bloomberg as a “threat” to anybody.

And fueling the repo market to keep up their “Greatest ever economy” scam to the tune of $410 Billion last year and $94.5 Billion so far this year. They’re feeding money into the market and also buying mortgage bonds again. They’re already “bailing them out”....AGAIN!
I think most people on here would. I don’t get why he’s considered electable though. Bloomberg doesn’t contrast enough with Trump. In a “lesser of 2 evils” election & in a decent economy, most folks would put their money on the incumbent.
The PM who ran the government that made Australia the best performing economy under the GFC is a dud in your mind? Yes Julia and Ruddy had successful leadership spills on each other but let's be honest the Coalition was absolutely worse and Labor united behind Bill Shorten..
Foreign aid is often laundered and sent back to unscrupulous politicians in the US. Another reason for spending US taxpayers' money is the Cloward and Piven dream of destroying the US economy.

Yes, I have. It's true jobs are disappearing, but when the Green New Deal occurs many many Government jobs will be needed due to the rapidly changing economy. Automation won't reach most of said jobs for years. That also doesn't really argue my point that he's not a Communist.
It's the reason that the gap between wealthy and not is widening though. As the wealthy pool more of the wealth, it becomes more scarce to obtain. The wealthiest control both what goes back into the economy to purchase, and what it costs to purchase.

We're having another financial crisis. The fed is pumping billions to the repo markets to keep the economy (stock market, banks) alive. The fucked up part is, regular people don't really see a difference.
universal basic income at a living level would take care of that. Given so few private positions offer any pensions and people are up to their eyes in debt, bailing ourselves out while powering the economy & eliminating poverty would seem a good strategy to pursue.

US? Quote: U.S. GDP growth will slow to 2.0% in 2020 from 2.2%. The GDP growth rate is expected to fall below the 2%-3% ideal range. Unemployment is forecast to continue below the natural rate. There isn't too much inflation or deflation. That's close to a Goldilocks economy.

Amazing that the economy is the best ever and yet Trump cut the 2.5% raise of federal employees to 1% because of economic hardship. This only proves that the economy is only good for the rich. Stop being a hypocrite and make America great by leaving and never coming back
Until recently, climate change usually played second, third or fourth fiddle to issues like jobs and the economy, so the GOP’s carbon revanchism didn’t really cost them. But now, protests and extreme weather have made climate change a bigger priority. http://bit.ly/39y2ca8
For what does it profit a man to gain the world but lose his soul. Doing the right thing matters. Truth and honest matters. Honoring the constitution matters. (Also. Trump is just continuing Obama’s economy - mostly by pumping up the deficit).

Just a matter of time. Cult is the only word I can come up with to explain the blind obedience to the pathological liar instead of using their own common sense. It's not hyperbole to make the Hitler comparison. He made Germany great, rebuilt military and dropped unemployment.
Summary of FACTS you deny: 23% FEWER jobs added than BO;essentially SAME growth as BO;LESS % decrease in unemployment than BO; HIGHER inflation than BO; 60+% INCREASE in deficit over 3 years;14 CENT increase in real average weekly earnings the past year.FAR from best in history!!
Facts: Obama started bringing down the unemployment from close to 11% to 4.20% when he left office. Yes, trump brought it down more by deregulation thus to create more competition within industry. Some jobs have health issues; 3 cents more over health. (?)

It's fact. Unemployment stats for Blacks have hit an all-time low.
Wrong Lowest black unemployment ever recorded
Meanwhile, working class Citizens and legal immigrants struggle with high unemployment because the blue collar labor sector has been saturated with foreign workers who ignored the very laws that were developed to prevent such a situation. You jerk.
Lowest unemployment levels since 50 years ago. Obama left the debt higher after he left so go BS someone else.
I said people work more jobs and you talk about low unemployment. Wages are not keeping up at all with productivity and most new income since the tax cuts has gone to the top 1%. These are basic economic facts, the morality argument is separate, and humans are not homo economicus
The poor Blacks suffering with the low unemployment!
So lets put the students first. Let's standardized costs across the USA and set a national curriculum with degrees that actually mean the student is job ready on day 1 and couple that with an apprenticeship program for high school students and regular unemployment insurance.

Black unemployment fell by 8% under Obama & 2% since Trump took office. Trump & the GOP simultaneously take credit for Obama’s successes while poo pooing his competency & abilities. Black folks how many of us haven’t experienced this in our work lives. Ask yourself that.
Perhaps the difference in our GDP and unemployment tells a different story
The largest drop in black unemployment was under Obama - from a 16.8% surge off the recession high in March 2010 DOWN to 7.8% in January 2017. @ realDonaldTrump # liestrumphastold @ GOP
It's a conspiracy theory that black unemployment is down in USA. And it's unsaid. It's stifling and claustrophobic.
Lowest unemployment rate since Ronald Reagan lowest black unemployment rate ever. Best GDP ever.
I lived and worked in Hazelton. These people are living in a town with 80 percent unemployment, more than 80 percent of the children suffer from fetal alcohol syndrome. Someone is paying them to be there. They would not do this on their own.
You still have work to do! “The unemployment rate for black workers fell to 5.5% from 6%, according to the Labor Department data. The previous record low of 5.9% was set in May 2018. White unemployment was 3.4% in August, up from 3.3% previously.” CNN Business
So you paid a guy to say you can beat the incumbent President who has the greatest economy and lowest unemployment for every segment in history. Great, but there is no plan so what does he endorses destroying prosperity? Weak. # KAG2020Landslide
Still twice as high as white unemployment. Please address that.
That was the peak unemployment of the recession.

US? Quote: U.S. GDP growth will slow to 2.0% in 2020 from 2.2%. The GDP growth rate is expected to fall below the 2%-3% ideal range. Unemployment is forecast to continue below the natural rate. There isn't too much inflation or deflation. That's close to a Goldilocks economy.

A black household earned median income of $40,258 in 2017 .That’s below a 2000 peak of $42,348, according to the Census Bureau. Drop in black unemployment came under Obama, when it fell from a recession high of 16.8 percent in March 2010 to 7.8 percent in January 2017.

I owe $120 in student loans and I cannot get back in school until it’s paid. My job closed unexpectedly and I’m awaiting unemployment benefits.
And unemployment wasn't high because of Obama - that happened because of the Great Recession which began way before Obama became president.
- With inflation, wage growth has only been 1.1% - Slower job growth than the previous 3 year period - Unemployment IS low; I’ll give you that, but many people have multiple jobs just to live paycheck to paycheck

Blester, read this slowly, he’s thanking PRESIDENT Obama, because he brought black unemployment down from 17% to 7%, Trump has barely moved the needle since then. Trump has been riding the momentum so you both should be thanking him for these numbers too.

Everyone's wages are raising. And black workers wages have been raising since 2012. And our unemployment numbers have been going down since 2012. From 16.7% to 7.7% under Obama. And continued to drop when he left office due to his policies.

And job growth. All unemployment numbers get skewed once someone stops collecting unemployment. Collecting unemployment is a sign that someone is unemployed/looking for work. Once they STOP collecting, it doesn't mean they are once again employed. Job growth numbers matter too.

Unemployment numbers are due to Obama’s policies. There are no other great records. That’s why Trump doesn’t list any.
Unemployment rates are much higher in regional areas due to decades of underfunding by state and federal governments. We are already divided on unemployment, wages, education, and heath care.
You Democratic candidates are killing us. The unemployment rate is at an all time low for all Americans. Anyone that wants to work has opportunities. Stop stroking the stupid liberals who can't think for themselves.

Guy do you actually understand how percentages work ? By the way the EU just got 13% smaller in GDP terms and unemployment % just shot up
Lol Obama tripled the stock market and brought unemployment from 11% to 4%. Trump lowered unemployment 1 whole point. Obama’s policies were leaps and bounds more effective.
Research suggests that many different situations can cause depression, including long-term unemployment, living in an abusive or uncaring relationship, long-term isolation or loneliness, and prolonged exposure to stress at work. Working with a counselor can help people to cope...
That was based on his new normal - you ditz unemployment dropped because they calculated it differently - if people seeking unemployment insurance dropped they said that must mean they got a job - in reality their insurance ran out and they quit looking - what a demwit
Can you imagine the pain the black community must feel, with having the lowest unemployment rate and everything. It must be unbearable
Seriously though, what SPECIFICALLY has he done to lower unemployment? For anyone?
Obama dropped unemployment 6%. 5x more than Trump. Obama created 1.8 million MORE jobs than Trump in his last three years vs Trump’s first three years GDP growth is down. you dopes will lie all day every day to protect your mad king.
Talk about unemployment, what about the 4,000 clerks that just lost their jobs at department stores! I bet they arent happy with the economy right now!
You do understand that unemployment is not a great measure of economic success. Industrial activity is at a ten year low.

Yes, but President Obama brought it down from 17% to 7% during his administration. The needle has barely moved since Trump took over. Trump, & @ SenateGOP should be thanking the Obama administration that they could ride the momentum of his unemployment numbers. Thank you Mr. Obama

His economy is barely average.31 states are over the unemployment rate,3 states are even,and only 16 states are below it.Not the greatest economy ever.
Unemployment numbers are fake news potus!
This is a pointless narrative, as unemployment reaches under 5% hiring will not grow as quickly. Stagnant wages and lower paying gig jobs are bigger issue's to discuss.

In 2018, unemployment for blacks actually spiked because more blacks started joining the workforce again. BLS does not account for Americans who are not actively looking. In 2018, blacks rejoined the workforce, that is the most telling story.
Let’s examine this truthfully. Your policies are not directly related to Black Unemployment. Employment as a whole is driven by the overall health of the economy.

Zero records. And the unemployment was in spite of you, not bc of anything you and your racist cronies have ever done.
But yet the wages aren’t changing and getting anyone out of poverty so that unemployment rate doesn’t mean much if you’re not adding the wages to go with it
@ POTUS keep destroying USA. Lowest unemployment rate in 50 yrs. Lowest rate for working women in 71 years, lowest for black and Hispanic Americans in history. Lowest rung of wage earners saw a 16% increase in income over 3 years of @ realDonaldTrump: 8 years of @ BarackObama +3%

in rural communities have had it since the Great Recession. Fewer disabled people in rural areas are employed now than were in 2008, even though the unemployment rate is low nationwide. It's a population that's hit disproportionately hard by disabilities—rural dwellers are 5%
You’ve got to laugh when Donald Trump makes a play for the Black and Hispanic vote with employment statistics. President Obama took black unemployment from 17% to 7% and Hispanic unemployment from 13% to 5% but Donald Trump tries to fool everyone and take credit
Yeah unemployment was already down low before he took office he’s only moved at 1% in some cases 1 1/2%. GDP is at 2.1% no better than when he took office

Thanks to @ David_Speers for pursuing the question of under-employment. Our unemployment figures only look positive because of the definition of employment. We need to acknowledge that people are not getting the hours they need to live without struggling. # insiders # auspoI
Unemployment in RSA must be declared a "crisis"! The people who are supposed to reduce high unemployment rate are the ones captured by capitalists. Capitalists always aims for big profits with less employees... @ tito_mboweni is forever on twitter bragging about his wealth! Eishhh

I don't know what you mean by consolation, trust me I have crossed unemployment 11years ago.
Have you considered how many people are working multiple jobs. When 1 person works 2 jobs it has the appearance of 2 people working. There are millions of people having to work 2 or 3 jobs to make ends meet. So there is you best unemployment numbers.
Govt. should allocate fund and budget for National Unemployment Registry.
I lived it. The retail store that I worked at went downhill and closed because 3 major industries in my area closed down, leading to the highest unemployment in my area since the great depression. Reagan's failed trickle down economics. Everything trickled out. I know. I lived it
Wow! Those people in Ohio might not agree. Why not campaign in the unemployment line Mikey? # UnfitForOffice
Abject in the sense of the unemployment rate. Or pulling us out of recession. Which one.
Trump is helping immigrant citizens. Unemployment is at or near all time lows. There are more opportunities than ever.
People *forget* that marginalization occurs bc material conditions of the cast aside out-group are dismal. Black trans women have the highest rates of unemployment, homelessness, nominal access to healthcare. The tangible effects of transphobia are these absences of human rights
Prince Andrew not making things easy for yourself are you, do you realise the privileged life you lead. Use your head Andy and stop out of the news give your mum a chance to save you.Or could you manage on unemployment benefit, bet you couldn't, so man up and stop what your doing
Ok, Bernie. The last time unemployment was was less than now was during 1942 when citizens were assembling war production in the streets.
Citizens get protected? Criminals are prevented from entering? The economy booms? Minority unemployment is at it’s lowest levels, ever? What am I missing?

I’m thrilled to vote for Trump again in 2020!!! Best president of my lifetime! Record high stock market, record low unemployment (especially for minorities and women), isis caliphate destroyed, embassy moved to Jerusalem, tax cuts, strong military!
Yes vote for less wages, more unemployment, lower stock market because the you believe the Democrats could get it right at some point, knowing that Trump has been the best president since Ronald Regan. The Democrats are no longer for the working class!
I am convinced there is no more difficult, time-consuming process than dealing with a state unemployment board.
Nope, but I think hes been so fuckin inept that he hasnt been able to stop the lowering of unemployment rates, stopping the criminal reforms that were just passed
More support for my thesis that best protection of “workers’ rights” is a vibrant labour market with low unemployment ... which the UK has. I’d rather be in UK with limited “rights” than Southern Europe where there’s no (hugely “well protected” and wage-controlled) work

Your faraghat, long term unemployment, money to get by without a job??
Unemployment was and still heading down when he walked into office. Thanks to Obama.
He really said unemployment glo up!!
What makes Trump racist? Is the black unemployment the lowest in history? Is it the prison reform that has released thousands of incarcerated people. 90% being black? Is it his support for black colleges? Is it his support for black owned businesses? Please. Enlighten us.
Also, since the Great Depression, every Democratic President left office with unemployment lower than when he took office & every Republican left with unemployment higher than when he took office. Yet they keep pushing the myth that the economy is always better under the GOP.
It's all a matter of official records. DOW was at 7000 when Obama took office, and was at 20,000 when he left on Jan 20th, 2017. GOP market crash created the Great Recession, which drove Unemployment rate to 10% by Nov 2009. Obama took it down to 4.7 by the time he left.

How are their individual/family health care expenses and access? Your 2016 campaign wouldn’t just accept unemployment rate as the only data that mattered. Why would we accept that as the only data point to consider now that you’re in office?
In October 2009, 10 months into Obama’s tenure, the US Unemployment Rate hit a high of 10%. When Trump took Office in January 2017, the rate was 4.8%. Are you implying that the rate dropped by 5.2% overnight?

Micro observances are essential. We have seen its role in elections in India. It's time to have honest and structured micro observances during efforts for elemination of poverty and unemployment. It's prime requisite is population planning at both macro and micro levels.

His economic policies have directly led to decreased unemployment, dude, I have made that abundantly clear. Lowering the corporate tax rate by 14% gave them a revenue boost to invest and expand, creating more jobs. De-regulation did the same, on a 24:1 ratio. USMCA & China 1 too
What about the over growing of violent extremism & intolerance among the young ones, Unemployment & online bullying & abuses. All these thing will surely hunt us if care is not taken. The region is in great mess and upside down shape, everything is not ok
Nonsense. He's doing a heck of a job for the ultra rich people. The stock market is growing, NOT the economy, and the stock market means rich people are richer. Unemployment was trending downward years before he took office. You're just buying in to their propaganda.
And those last 7.5 years was the longest period of growth in US history, growth that Trump inherited. GDP growth has not been greater under Trump; the decrease in unemployment has been on the same slope under Trump as it was under Obama. The only thing that has increased /1
So when a W2 employer demotes u or treats u like crap within guidelines of the law, dont u just find another job? Does Uber's attitude towards u change making $15 hr, less tips cuz of fare increases and capped unemployment benefits u may never use? Is a union gonna force respect?
Bernie you need to be honest and tell everyone their taxes would rise significantly with all these "free" programs. After you strip all capital from billionaires there is no money going into building businesses so companies will go out of business and unemployment rises.
No doubt. I’m curious about state level data in low unemployment states like Pa., Iowa, Georgia that stuck with federal minimum.

Your first entry into this thread was "3.5% unemployment". We've pointed out that there's no evidence Trump had anything to do with that. You're trying to distract from the fact that you have no evidence of that by pointing to the lowering of taxes. Still waiting for proof.

Lowest black unemployment in U.S history.
You sound really butt hurt. The wall is very much needed. But back to the topic at hand. California is a very rich state that has one of the highest if not the highest unemployment rate? Why is that? This didn’t just happen in 3 years. Go back to where it started from
Please do not ask about currency, borders, austerity or unemployment, stick to it's all Westminster's fault, contempt, braveheart, whinge, bleat...you get the idea...

Unemployment was lower last presidency than it is under Trump's presidency. The stock market is artificially inflated and his 26 rape allegation having ass has a toxic, incoherent personality.
Unemployment this low says otherwise. Good luck explaining how the numbers lie.

We’ve been using wrong economic measurements. GDP, unemployment rate, stock market don’t reflect how bottom 80% are actually doing. @ AndrewYang has been saying this his entire campaign.

These people complain Trump is racist or trump this trump that, give me a break..the guy used to be a democrat, he’s done more for the minority culture than any president In modern day...meanwhile the country is doing better than ever with black unemployment at its lowest
MSM are giddy with excitement every time they talk about jobs number, the stock market, and unemployment rate as if the man currently occupying the White House made this happen all by himself. I can’t remember during the Obama years so much excitement was there as he dugout.

Yes vote for less wages, more unemployment, lower stock market because the you believe the Democrats could get it right at some point, knowing that Trump has been the best president since Ronald Regan. The Democrats are no longer for the working class!

Nonsense. He's doing a heck of a job for the ultra rich people. The stock market is growing, NOT the economy, and the stock market means rich people are richer. Unemployment was trending downward years before he took office. You're just buying in to their propaganda.
Those GDP figures just keep falling. I thought the tax cut for the rich people was supposed to get that GDP above 3%. Trump keeps telling us it's the best economy ever and the stock market is setting new highs, but GDP sucks. How can that be? With the fed adding billions daily.
Sadly, I agree and most people are not invested in the stock market. I think what kills civilizations and governments is willful ignorance

First, @ IvankaTrump knows nothing about our GDP. If its not a handbag, she probably can't even spell it. Secondly, she has no business representing our country. Nepotism is INAPPROPRIATE and should be illegal. Third, I know # NepotismBarbie really loves playing politics - but no.
I think Energia is correct. I also think that periods of corrupt governance lead to bad outcomes for the Country. The only reason that real estate makes up a large part of BCs GDP is because gov has been selling off assets to foreign investors. Timber, mining, oil&gas, hydro, etc
It's like this every time a Republican gets in office. Debt skyrockets, deficit balloons and economy goes to crap. Dem gets elected fixes it and the cycle continues. Since 1982 its been this way. Jimmy Carter had a stronger GDP growth then trump so did Clinton & Obama pic.twitter.com/jgPXZfxzcv

Long term economic policies, such as Tax Cuts, should address Consumer spending which slowed to 1.8%, the weakest since the 1st quarter. A DIRECT TAX CUT to Consumers is the solution; not a marginal one. GDP expected by the FED to be 2.0% in 2020. 3% was normal prior to 2008.
You mean like border security, hi stocks, VA & tax reform, millions of new jobs, 3.7% unemployment, high GDP, lowest black, Hispanic & women in history, highest women pay ever, reduced govt. regs, highest consumer confidence in 17 years, deals with NATO, China, NOKO & NAFTA?

There are only three countries that spend more on their military's as a percent of their GDP. So no. But each of those countries have "free" universal healthcare. Universal Healthcare is more affordable and costs less per GDP than our system.

In his first three years, Trump's economy has created 1.8 million fewer jobs than Obama in his last three years. The GDP growth has also slowed. And, the economy has only been this good because of the cash injected by Trump's policies, adding to the debt by $1T/year. Not good.
estonia puts in more of their gdp but denmark still puts in more, and our nato spending is on the rise already, we are very involved in international operations, not that it matters because no one asked you to make your army as big as you CHOSE to make it

Yes like the tax cuts for millionaires was going to bring us to 4%, 5% and 6% GDP.......meanwhile, here at 2.1%, the debt and deficit are exploding....
Weird how that line intersects neatly with the mass exploitation of fossil fuels. Probably just a coincidence how GDP tracks with fossil fuel consumption!
After @ BarackObama doubled the deficit, bailed out banks and wall street, destroyed our manufacturing resulting in lowest GDP EVER. This went on for 8 years.

They are definitely zillions of well-being increases, not captured by GDP. But GDP is not a measure of well-being, so why should it capture?
Trump promised 5% GDP growth. He has yet to exceed 3% growth. LOWER GDP growth than under President Obama.
You put the G in GDP
Most EU countries have a lower debt as percentage of GDP than the US and other countries which have large welfare states like Australia is very low around 40%

Are you serious? Mining and energy resources make up about 70% of our GDP. Australia lacks economic complexity as per a recent Harvard study. This creates enormous exposure to us when we experience global volatility.
Yes sir, you must be aware that foundation of that GDP was laid by a technocrat govt.... will you allow such govt in Pakistan???

One problem though, there is an error. It says $2.7B GDP growth, well the current GDP is $22,390B, so a growth of $2.7B would be growth of 0.001% over the 8 year term of 44. If it were accurate I'd steal it too, hahaha.

Yeah unemployment was already down low before he took office he’s only moved at 1% in some cases 1 1/2%. GDP is at 2.1% no better than when he took office
Facts are even Jimmy Carter had higher GDP growth. If this was is high gear we probably need a new engine in the White House

Trump is already cutting welfare programs to the bone and spending the surplus on god knows what. If our debt exceeds our GDP beyond a certain point, Congress will starve us into submission. Look at the damage Trump has already done and start from there. We're not starting at 0
The point I was trying to make is imho still valid – growth in GDP per capita alone is not a very good proxy to discuss widespread wealth, it’s more complex than that – but the difference between Europe’s and America’s bottom 50% are not as extreme as in the first table.

Those GDP figures just keep falling. I thought the tax cut for the rich people was supposed to get that GDP above 3%. Trump keeps telling us it's the best economy ever and the stock market is setting new highs, but GDP sucks. How can that be? With the fed adding billions daily.
And those last 7.5 years was the longest period of growth in US history, growth that Trump inherited. GDP growth has not been greater under Trump; the decrease in unemployment has been on the same slope under Trump as it was under Obama. The only thing that has increased /1

Easy enough for you to look up,but Cliff’s notes-Per capita GDP for Europe as a whole is ~37K. For the entire US, its GDP per capita is ~60K. Kentucky is ~40K. So, in terms of goods and services produced, Kentucky is higher than Europe and the US crushes EU on a per capita basis.
By the time we over compensate for Chinas lack of supply, GDP drop may only be temporary? Thinking out loud.
The countries that are net contributors are at the bottom of GDP growth.
GDP was heading towards recession and many other things have reversed Can you say magic wand and those jobs are coming back
GDP is detrimental to humanity though.
What disparate views. I keep reading articles about how China is basically on full shut down. I then read an article saying their GDP could drop to 2-3% in a really bad case scenario. Somebody dropped acid in my coffee. The supply shock looks really huge to me (and others).
"We're bringing it (the GDP) from 1 percent up to 4 percent. And I actually think we can go higher than 4 percent. I think you can go to 5 percent or 6 percent," Trump said at an Oct. 19, 2016, presidential debate in Las Vegas.
StatsCan had it around 8.6% about a month ago. But continue, I'm not taking issue with any other thing you stated in either thread. Reasonable takes IMO. I just get annoyed with the myth that O&G is a huge part of our GDP. the % we are talking about here are not huge

Stagflation, yes and why? In my view: Ageing society. The massive amout of pensioners is a burden. And becoming 90 is basically the rule in japan. Also Japan would be bankrupt if not for the fierce patriotism of bond-buyers. They are @ 270% indebtedness of GDP now.
By the end of 2020, the UK's GDP could be $5.5 billion lower because of # Brexit-related uncertainty surrounding trading relations with the EU. New study:https://bit.ly/2uCnsMN
Well, Gateway Pundit being for # RepublicanRubes aside, lets go with it.... So youre saying Obama's GDP growth was awful, making him a terrible President, yes?

If Nigeria had the kind of growth we had under the PDP for 30years, we would have bn by now over $1tr in gdp.
They WANT the poor to leave. Per World Bank data, 12% of Guatemala’s GDP comes from remittances with more than 90% of that money coming from Guatemalans in the U.S.. That essentially makes illegals the country’s 2nd biggest export after bananas. And the gov't doesn't have to help
We’ve been using wrong economic measurements. GDP, unemployment rate, stock market don’t reflect how bottom 80% are actually doing. @ AndrewYang has been saying this his entire campaign.
Gov study in Nov 2018 showed cumulative benefit of all possible trade deals to be between 0.2 and 0.4% of GDP, so not that new. Loss from new barriers to EU trade probably of order of 3 - 7% so you get the general gist. https://twitter.com/MsHelicat/status/1228788163503624194 …
They said about 11% of nominal GDP which is still a considerable contribution.
We are not in a structural deficit therefore commitment to the growth of the economy will balance the budget. Trudeau is doing the same as Trump to a less degree on a smaller scale. Our debt to GDP is going down, because of economic growth.
We didn’t elect commissioners. It was commissioners who really made the decisions. In return for what? Our overall GDP has been in a downtrend since the 70s

Here is the # ObamaTrajectory in terms of GDP growth. pic.twitter.com/mPg5oPc7tC
Which leads to the argument on what his tax cuts will do long term - now that you acknowledge Obama’s recover plan took us out of the terrible recession we were in and led to a thriving growth economy. Where GDP performed much better than it currently is today.

1) we know that isn’t true because NAFTA and USMCA are almost the exact same thing. 2) didn’t trump say we were gonna have 4-5% GDP after tax cuts and now economy is worse than under previous president?
Unchanged because the fires are normal and I've been ignoring the reporting on it because it's done by idiots. At this point I'm suspecting they deliberately create situations which put rural communities in peril because rebuilding is good for Muh GDP.
All these analysts are saying GDP could be “sub 5% growth” If no one is doing anything, doesn’t GDP collapse?

Dude, he had his chance and f*cked it up with misguided spending on entitlements - FFS, we had over 47M people on SNAP and People collecting UI for 4 YEARS with being in school/job training waived - and over regulation (even light bulbs were included, FFS). 1.5% GDP
Would be GREAT for GDP

Our GDP growth in d 1990s before the emergence of the PDP was almost zero,from $30B in 1990 to $33B as at 1998 ,PDP grew it to $560B b4 this relic took us downwards to stagnation and decline . Democracy under the PDP was good for Nigeria compared to d decadence of d Abacha yrs.
Doors were not closed to those that we elect to do the work, our politicians were involved so we the UK had a say in everything that was agreed, as I said UK Governments were at fault, but the numbers do not lie, UK gave away small amount of GDP (fishing) in return for much more

Guy, you've got your facts wrong again. The bread just shrank quite a LOT as well as the butter but I know your answer; more EU!! So, squandering 1% of the EU27's GDP isn't enough, we're going for 1.3%. Good luck with that! https://twitter.com/guyverhofstadt/status/1228780412387893248 …

King Leopold lost his colony, the Congo Free State, for turning it into a "brutal forced labor camp". It was a big story in Europe. Colonial powers abolished slavery, introduced modern infrastructure and institutions. These things last. GDP per capita = living standards.

Because he's not. All of the money is already allocated by parliament. We give only .28% of GDP to foreign aid, far less than we used to. And we give far less than many European nations who are at about 1% So explain how you call this a bribery tour when we give so little?
Oil and Gas accounts for much of Canada's GDP The economy is interconnected. The industry still fuels our life. Don't kid yourself. We all are connected to the success of oil and gas.
Uh... I believe you’re confusing “deficit” with national debt? The deficit is calculated against GDP by percentage... The federally purported national debt is actually around $24trillion, and its cumulative between presidents since Bush.
