Side hustle might not be a bad idea in this economy.
Nationalisation per se, does not equal socialism. Even if the entire major economy was nationalised,that would still not be socialism. Stalin kept the nationalised economy as it was still superior 2 capitalism,but Russia was not socialist. JC is a long way short of even that.
In this year of pandemic, protest and a decimated economy, this is the first sign of hope that I have seen in 2020. No matter how Trump spins this, the crowds that he touted were not there. Maybe, just maybe, we are seeing the end of the Trump debacle...

Fascism is state control of the economy, and nearly everything else. It's irrelevant to this conversation.
This is delusional. In Chile, Allende did lots to help the people before the US sanctioned them to failure then thousands were disappeared under Pinochet and the economy suffered. Millions are starving in Venezuela now due to US sanctions that hurt the people and not the regime.
It's good to see his support finally waning as voters realize how absurdly racist he is. Tanked economy, poor COVID response, and a weak police reform order. He's a tiny little racist man whose days are over.
@yimmys85 its also b.s. though. The more they can keep markets volatile, the more money they'll make as the economy recovers. That's my two cents. Could be wrong of course.

Austerity was the right course of action. However, due to the coalition moderating planned cuts, and EU referendum causing an economic slow down, it's been too slow to accomplish its goals of getting the deficit down, and then debt to economy down to safe levels.
as a staunch anarcho-communist allow me to say: you should definitely be reading and thinking about marx and marxism and what his articulation of class and political economy and power meant and continue to mean

The debate about how much lockdowns affected the economy vs leaving everything be will be discussed for decades because there is no way to *know* one way or the other A path was chosen, what happened happened
Oh for sure. It’s always a cost benefit analysis. Like science tells us that the virus will spread faster if economy is opened up, but we can’t survive if economy is closed indefinitely. But I think benefit weighs so much in favor of cost re masking.

You put America’s economy in a downward dive!
That's NOT the point, which you likely understand. The point is to maximize the efficacy of the reopening -- that is, IF you believe reopening should FULLY restart the economy, not partially restart it as the wealthiest won't come back out.

Oh no they're just going to power through and try to restart the economy by sacrificing a few million people. Line goes up.
Wait for the economy to stabilize. Don't wanna lose all that hard earned money in a second crash.
Probably bragging about Obama's economy from several months ago.
Besides, funding won't come that easy as well. Moreover, our relations with most nations that matter are not yet that sound. At this moment the potential investors we have are also potential exploiters. We are being taken advantage of. Repair relations, stabilise the economy.

COVID Is not a hoax its a real virus (as dangerous as severe flu) but shutting down the economy was/is stupid. The reason why she feels this was is so many Dems didnt crack down on protests but allowed them b/c of "racism is worse that Wuhan Flu." Thats BS

debt now $1.5 trillion and growing by $ about $250 billion/month. Trudeau is deliberately destroying the market economy so he can usher in a post covid command style economy copying China's system of state corporatism that was developed by Butts hero, the late Maurice Strong
10 mins left and we start on the economy
Wearing a mask is a choice, the virus has killed less then what the flu does. If they wanna risk getting sick then thats on them, the faster everyone gets it the faster we build immunity, idiot. The suicide deaths from shutting down the economy will kill way more people.

But focusing solely on regrowing the economy won't help anyone. That's how we got to this point in the US. They've pushed bs trickle down economics and laissez faire, no regulation conservatism and it's wrecked the economy. Somehow, it's bad for the economy if people are starving
The most insidious thing about trickle-down economics isn’t believing that if the rich get richer, it’s good for the economy. It’s believing that if the poor get richer, it’s bad for the economy.

Trump was lucky to win in 2016. Now he was a strong favorite against Biden but he is running out of luck (virus, economy, protests, etc.) and he will lose.
And the Soviet Union’s economy was destroyed and then they collapsed
We are building the wall. The falsely shut down economy was done through the corona virus shutdown hoax, and the rioting, looting, violence belong to the corrupt dnc. All blame lies at the feet of the Democrats. Try spinning this yarn somewhere else. Not falling for it.

No one should prioritize the market over human life. The economy is shit right now but opening up prematurely isnt helping anything. In fact it keeps people from filing from unemployment while they have extremely reduced hours so its hurting many blue collar people financially

Two people that have no clue how an economy works (one a deserter general and the other a narcissistic computer scientist) get together to solve an economic crisis. Kick that can further down the road and Micho might just die of old age but not before the country starves to death
then after they have a record it's basically impossible so they have no other option to resort to crime to survive because the normal economy deliberately fails them. California literally used prisoners as firefighters during wildfires and then when people got out of prison
OMG those tweets asking if they know someone who had covid-19 and looking for the big conspiracy!! Why all the world should fuck their economy up? Please someone tell me one fucking good reason for it!! You stupid imbeciles!! I also don’t know know idiots like you, but U exist!!
this was the best economy we've had in decades prior to the worst pandemic in the US in generations. As for 1k dying tonight from covid. CDC has the mortality rate @0.4% so to kill 1k he would need 250,000 in attendance and everyone to get infected and for 85% to be age 65+

The “gig economy” makes sense within the fantasy logic of videogames, and nowhere else
Expose them. There's a rate of interest attached to all money in this economy. At just 5% simple interest, the wealthiest will take the entire money supply every 20 years. It's deplorable and nobody can defend it. Expose them.

What facts? The election hasn’t happened and the economy has just started to come back. These protests will lose steam in a few weeks. Anyone know if Biden has any solutions or a pulse?
My personal view, is that Zambia is a much easier economy to rebuild, but we are overwhelmed with our politics.
Once we really get the antibody results flowing in I think the mortality rate of this thing is going to fall through the floor and we are going to look pretty damn silly for shutting down a globally economy because of it.
:( But honestly we were teenagers in the 90s/End of History era with a booming economy and nothing but puppies and rainbows before us. Lot easier to remain oblivious when you formative years aren't a decade plus of economic and political crisis.
It's not what Trump hoped for, but there's enough of those deplorables to get infected or to spread the corona to infect thousands of other people and to get the economy and America shut down again
I know but it's typical knee jerk the economy is fucked blame old people and make them fix it.
he really thought he was going to walk off air force one and the streets of tulsa would be jam packed from the airport to the venue like it was fkn v-e day and he did something the last 6mos other than get impeached, destroy the economy, and kill 120k people
Just being snarky. Just saying well aware of the many points in time where the American institutions of hove compromised and not give people of color full access to the economy. Repeatedly the choice has been they can wait
Make no mistake, the radical left shit down the economy, and say it's ok to loot & riot and physically attack people! Yes there is no mistake the radical.left was the first side to not follow social distancing rules. Now it's Team Trump's turn!! suck it Dan! 4 more yrs of Trump
This is distracting away from the economy.
Finally his CON is over. He's a lawless lying lazy loser and the American people see it. Funny what happens when you turn the military on your own citizens, get impeached, fail on covid, crash the economy and stoke racial tensions. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN ELECT JOE BIDEN PATRIOT
Ouch! Not good. Be smart, New Mexico! Otherwise, we'll shut down again and it'll be the mask & social distancing naysayers fault. You can't have an open economy if you're spreading an insidious virus that is always looking for a host. # MaskUp # NMStrong # AllTogetherNM

Example 1: in Runescape, high end weapons require repair after C charges. This forms a gold sink to help keep inflation in checks, and in some cases, creates an ingame economy built around collecting the resource needed to repair it (see:invention and Divine charges)

I wonder if he will come out: 1) Curse the # MSM 2) Blame @ HillaryClinton 3) Say @ JoeBiden is a loser 4) Make up fake # coronavirus numbers 5) Say the # economy is great and # unemployment is perfect 6) Say that he needs to go 7) Quickly escape to # AF1
Trump has managed to do in 4 years what he claims all his scapegoats have done - HE took our jobs; not immigrants - HE destroyed our economy; not Obama - HE ruined our place in the world; not China - HE made this country unsafe; not Muslims All bc he didnt take Covid srsly!
COVID was a joke. We all know it. It was a tool used by democrats to hurt our economy. You guys are still journalists right? Go investigate!

The Democrats impeached themselves with that sham. They then moved on to trying to destroy the economy, in collusion with China, and scapegoated Trump. Now they're exposed as terrorist supporters. They should be arrested and put on trial for supporting terrorism against the USA.

It's hard to tell because as you mentioned, it's mixed in with general 16-year old mess. Are they mocking 30 somethings for wanting a stable job because they haven't had to pay bills yet or because they've intuited something about the future economy?
1) Obama’s stimulus package is what got our economy here until Trump fucked it by not handling corona fast enough. 2) Obama has federally investigated 13 police departments. Trump has 1. 3) Obama was the one who pushed for body cams. Trump has bolstered police unions. Next?
No, more are unemployed now bc of the lockdown. Also did I mention the riots? Oh yeah the riots have put more than 1000 small businesses out of business. Riots have skyrocketed unemployment, so no, its not donnies fault. Obama had more than 40 million ppl unemployed, just sayin
Enjoy your unemployment benefits like the rest of us.

Good luck filing for unemployment, Brad!
I hear buyers are eager and offering more than asking price for houses that are listed. I'm finding that odd given all the unemployment and furloughing.
I think the nation is mesmerized by MSM and duped by the Left. By this time next year, or at least Christmas of 2021, we will see a great demise of the country and the economy falling apart and plenty of unemployment so that people rely on the government that much more.

Well let's see, he's helped minorities more than any other president with the prison reform, opportunity zones etc. He is making China pay money they should've been paying this whole time. Had record low unemployment across the board, economy was bustling before the pandemic.

I think the govt should refloat the economy with _generous_ unemployment benefits aka jobseeker. That would help the most affected, would give some sense we are in this together, and would be excellent economic stimulus. # insiders

These kind of tropes go nowhere. Life is no picnic. I’ve supported myself my whole life. Never been on unemployment nor received a trust fund. I have never shied away from hard work and immigrated on the strength of my own skills without sponsorship.
stupid lockdowns by Dems created unemployment
Holy shit I just checked my bank account and my unemployment finally came in wtf okay better late than never
In Nevada 40,000 people have yet to see a dime of unemployment!!! I couldn't imagine. I'd have to go get any job I could.
Better get up early on Monday, Brad, I hear it’s tough to get the out to unemployment.

Trump did what he said he would do. Bring more jobs back to Americans. He had the lowest unemployment rates before COVID. The American public is fickle with the cost of merchandise. Trump is not dumb. He produces the goods cheap so that can be brought to the masses.
Brad, I've read that you don't reside in FL anymore. But if you've maintained legal residence here, get to http://floridajobs.org as soon after you're fired as you can. The unemployment system here (I've been dealing with it for 3+ months) is a fiasco, worse than Trump-Tulsa
Brad is going to be in the unemployment line Monday morning!
On Monday, unemployment will raise by at least one.

No one wants to hear about “lowest black unemployment” and “women in the workforce” for the hundredth time, while our cities burn and a one sided race war is going on.

Let's talk about the impact of unemployment the effects of R5 Billions that just go missing, that could have created millions of jobs for SAns. Let's talk about the lack of integrity, accountability associated with politicians who like celebrities.

The typical forecast told by CBO or private market is that unemployment will be above 10% or best case scenario above 9% by end of the year, but that's still a terrible outcome. That's very elevated unemployment #'s that we've really only seen couple of times before since WWII.
On the bright side for Brad, the $600 a week pandemic supplement to unemployment insurance still has a few weeks left
That's funny cause hes fixing to mop the floor with Biden. And again it's your opinion that hes screwed up " so badly". Dude had the economy booming before the virus and its already coming back. Unemployment was down, our military is stronger. Have a good evening
at 9:49am the # Insiders host got around to unemployment figures released this week, which impacts on millions and millions of people. Like sensible voices everywhere, Taylor warns that a sudden withdrawal of jobseeker supplement and jobkeeper will be catastrophic [paraphrased].
So, whatcha gonna do on Monday morning, Brad? Guess we'll see you show up in next Thursday's Labor report on unemployment.
I think the teens trolled him. Brad gonna be standing in the unemployment line tomorrow.

Natives face the highest rates of poverty. Where is the support? MY REZ HAS AN 89% UNEMPLOYMENT RATE. Our per capita income is a QUARTER of the US average. But most people think of casinos and think we get free money, that is not only really wrong. But it's Anti-Native.
Nice try pumpkin. Hope you haven’t purchased anything you cannot pay for. Also do you get to file for unemployment?
Try using that brain of yours for all of 2 seconds. Bars and restaurants need to be open bc businesses are going out of business and over 5 million people in Cali filed for unemployment. You might be lucky enough to have a job that wasn’t affected but other ppl weren’t so lucky
# insiders Unemployment. Worst since the Depression. First mention at 9:49.
Record unemployment against what, (considering PANDEMIC and all)? pic.twitter.com/RcIulOV3py
The record breaking comeback is because unemployment was at a near all time low and when businesses started opening back up people went back to work. Of course that was going to happen, yet you somehow manage to try and take credit for that. Amazing.
This rightwing snowflake’s taxes are paying for your unemployment mate. I suggest you get out of your warrior armchair and make a true difference, instead of spewing your crap, including your futile attempt to intimidate or shame me. LOL

Hey @ parscale.....If you need help navigating the Florida unemployment system, then too bad, because it sucks. You’ll have to sell a car. # TrumpRally
I’m a subject matter expert. I live here. And unemployment will go down rapidly in the next 6 months. . It was at historical lows leading up to the Covid pandemic. Ps. You can purchase healthcare insurance without a job as well. Why? Because it’s America.
Because of trump's failed # COVID19 response, Black Americans are dying at more than 3x the rate of white people Since Feb, Black unemployment has nearly tripled to 16.8% 41% Black owned business closure compared to 17% for white owned businesses 2/3
Bruh Economy aint coming back. Almost 50 million people are out of work. PPP and extra unemployment benefits end in July. Thousands more will be homeless and out of a job.
Guess you missed the facts that news he was elected turned employment around. Unemployment #’s dropped the day his win was announced. Companies packing to LEAVE AMERICA STAYED! Wages rose and America became FULLY EMPLOYED AND MORE. The FACTS are in the numbers from that time!
Ashley is clearly a Trump hater and watcher of CNN. She doesn't have real facts, she's spouting their talking points ie, lie. She apparently didn't see the soaring of the stock market during the past 3+ years or the lowest unemployment in 50 years for women, blacks and latinos.

I've been working throughout the entire pandemic, and people are getting paid $800 dollars to sit on their ass. People also are taking unemployment while they still have a job, so sorry that being tipped is what's the big issue nowadays
It seems more a case of deaths and unemployment will continue to sweep tens of thousands away, opposition pathetic, & Johnson stays in power
So weird that Fox has no footage of the “protesters”. How did they manage to stop 800,000 people from standing outside? Enjoy unemployment.
Yeah, ok, idiot! The latest jobs report was a lie because a short two weeks later 2.1 million people filed for unemployment! Keep believing that orange clown, who said 1 million people signed up for his rally yet 8k showed up! Get ready for a November ASS kicking! Lol!

@ SenTomCotton Saw you on Fox news. Everything you said was a "Fucken Lie" 13% unemployment, Over 120,000 have died over Covid 19, Over 2 million with the virus. Treaties destroyed. Losing allies throughout the world. The economy is in the toilet. The Health of the country

You are such a liar. No protestors. No one wants to go. Enjoy unemployment. I’m sure Trump will throw you under the bus for this one.
Well, Bradley. Your unemployment check will have the extra $600 every week only if your employer says it was COVID-19 related. Doesn't sound promising.
You could even file unemployment as due to the virus you are receiving a reduced income...
Brad will soon be collecting a weekly $600 unemployment check.
you preach jobs. Current U.S. unemployment rate is 13.3% staggeringly high.. you talk about law and order yet chaos is everywhere .. @ Mike_Pence
I can't remember that. Trump has done more for prison reform where so many were released, pardoned and skill training in prisons. Almost all prisoners have had their sentences reduced. Also HUD under Ben Carson has done a lot. Black unemployment (before Covid) all time low.

I guess @ EricTrump will be applying for unemployment soon
No one should prioritize the market over human life. The economy is shit right now but opening up prematurely isnt helping anything. In fact it keeps people from filing from unemployment while they have extremely reduced hours so its hurting many blue collar people financially

Because close to 5 million people filed for unemployment in California. And businesses are going out of business. So unless we’re getting more government money, which we aren’t, then we need to open up
So everybody in on that unemployment scam lemme hold a dollar I’ll send it back when y’all get booked
Obama cut unemployment in half, doubled the stock market, created more jobs in his last 3 years than trump did in his first 3 before the pandemic and had 76 straight months of economic growth. chump is at 13.3% unemployment and 120k dead Americans.
honestly but the unemployment >>
Brad is going to be really upset when he experiences first hand how impossible Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis have made it to file for unemployment in Florida
We filled the jobs with Non-Americans, and you're surprised the unemployment rate went down? Uh... they got to hire cheap overseas labor, LMAO.
Do you know how many people have filed for unemployment and how backed up the system is??? How people can’t live on $1,200 for months?
Hahaha oh yah almost forgot along with the 120,000 deaths at his ineptitude...we can also lump in 17 percent unemployment....that alone is a guaranteed win am I right? Oh hang on you all gonna tell us about some report that nails the email lady?! Enjoy it!
Don't bother him now He is trying to get through to Unemployment
Brad’s gonna be on the unemployment line real soon.
To be fair he is the first president to have 3 million people file unemployment in one week. No other president has ever done that in the nation's history.
loser. You'll be on the unemployment line next to berman.
And thanks to covid, that unemployment went straight back up... dumbasses
I think someone else might be collecting unemployment soon.
unemployment services has been withholding my payments for a while and marking them as “pending” bc they thought they overpaid me (???) but I guess they figured their shit out bc I just looked and they deposited the last several checks into my account all at once

Because business are going out of business and close to 5 million ppl filed for unemployment in Cali. Things need to open up so people can make money and feed their families. Its not like we’re getting another government check
Does Brad know that unemployment insurance runs out at the end of July? He'll find out soon
@ parscale unfortunate that the extra $600 in unemployment runs out soon. Bad timing for you Brad. Bad timing.
Honestly the first thing I’m buying when I get my unemployment is a fucking car
Boy, bye! Welcome to the unemployment line!
Anyone that has supported this corrupt administration needs to NEVER work again. They need to be held responsible for their absolute indifference to the law, the constitution and American citizens. Let them try to get food stamps, unemployment, etc. Fuckers.

Liberals’ vile attack on arts students and grads is another chapter in neoliberal story which blames unemployment on individual choices rather than on the systemic failures of the government to create opportunity for all. ‘You failed because you followed your passion’. Gross.
Even with high unemployment, they couldn't get people to come on the weekend. I was assured the $1,200 was enough.
The timing of the announcement was an attempt to distract from unemployment rates but Speers just dismissed this possibility

They moved like 20 people? This is terrific footage to go with his inaugural crowd size. He is going to be bat shit crazy after this if he isn't already. Add Brad P to unemployment line.

Businesses should be able to choose to open and people should be able to choose to go inside. If you're so scared you can CHOOSE to stay home. Shit you gon make more on unemployment anyways
they chose the job, there is plenty of jobs out there and it is not hard to get one. and if people dont have a job due to the pandemic, they are actually making well over enough with the relief bonus on top of normal unemployment. please learn ab what you talk ab b4 talkin to me.
good news for her she’ll qualify for unemployment soon :)
So far, no mention of issues that matter like unemployment rate, depressed economy, robodebt fix, bushfire recovery. Instead we get branch stacking & cyber security which has been around for ever.

Of course. Just like they want unemployment to go up, stock market to crash and cities to burn
Where are all of the people who were suppose to be at Donald J. Trump’s Tulsa rally? There seem to be more people standing in unemployment lines across the nation. @ WhiteHouse @ realDonaldTrump @ foxnewsalert
Really? Is that why the overflow stage was not needed? Get real. Nobody wants to risk their health for a president that doesn’t give a shit about his people. Unemployment is still incredibly high and we lose our benefits in a couple weeks, he should do something about that.
Oklahoma had an unemployment rate of less than 3% before Covid-19 and now it is hovering at nearly 14%. Perhaps people are more worried about how to pay the rent.
I did the math on the Obama Biden administration's unemployment - an average of 7.8% across 8 years. Normal levels is around 4%. # TrumpRallyTulsa # Tulsa
While there's 40+ mill currently unemployed? And that doesn't count those of us who have a small business and can't even get a unemployment rep on the phone to talk to! It takes a very blind or ignorant person to not see how many are struggling right now

The unemployment rate has always been a worthless number based on people getting jobseeker welfare. Just because you don’t get it does mean you’re not looking for work.
Its because of special Covid funds available to non-wage earners, that we see some figures. I suspect a fair percent of these workers do not apply for Covid funds, so the unemployment figure may be considerably higher.
Exactly. It is the Alyssa Milano's of the world that incite hatred and division with their non stop whining over the plain fact that President Trump won and against all odds has made life better for the country with lowest unemployment and increased trade. Hollyweird the problem.
Looks like someone will be added to the unemployment rolls next week
Yeah. That one lady in the black tee shirt they arrested looked pretty radical. You'll still get the extra $600 unemployment for one more month, tho. https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/1274485952757428224 …pic.twitter.com/rDh8gxbpee

But your picture is untrue. @ realDonaldTrump has promised to fix America and make it better for every American and he has done that. Lowest unemployment for every demographic prior to the Pandemic, more money given to HBCU's than any other president, criminal justice reform.
@ InsidersABC record unemployment, increased university fees, secret trials, PM challenging Speaker and all you can talk about is branch stacking. And constantly interrupting Chris Bowen. # auspol
I just wonder what the unemployment level would be if the ABS definition of being employed wasn't 'working one (1) hour or more'.
Trump didn't ask for the Coronavirus to happen. He didn't ask for the left to freak out and start looting and destroying cities. Didn't hear from you when the economy was booming and unemployment was at a record low.
Blame the Chinese for the unemployment!! That is not Trump's fault!

And now they're tearing it down because nobody showed. How are you going to like unemployment there Brad?
Question is why are they so desperate to get him out. Lowest unemployment rate & highest average earning under this Administration. Other motives?
He's been getting rich scamming Trump and his funds. So he'd better have stuck some of the dough away unless he intends to go right back to work. Plus, with all the showy stuff he's bought, he better have it paid off. Unemployment won't be enough.
I could never hate on the folks getting $600 + unemployment checks. I hope y’all get it for the rest of the year forreal.

No, Trump won't let Brad contribute to the astonishingly high unemployment number. Trump will just feed him to Bill Barr and we'll never see Brad again.
Anyone out there not gotten their stimulus check and still aren’t getting their unemployment
Good thing unemployment still has that extra 600 bucks a week. Can you survive on that? Cause I have a feeling tomorrow you should file.

Not totally wrong. First of all right now the entire world today face crisis economy and higher rates of unemployment right now. That people face problem in foreign countries, UN has to deal with theirs government to work about fixing theirs problem,that not belong to us.

Pfffft. Statists mainly. The state captured capitalism long ago. Every business activity requires a liscence, explicit or implicit. Shutting down businesses in pandemic is a flex of central state control. Now it is eating itself and providing sideshow distractions.

India's GDP growth rate in 2019: 5.3%. China: 6.1%.
The sheer rapidity of the decline in hours, about 9% so far, is a completely unprecedented shock to the labour market. It alone is consistent with about a 6% decline in GDP, an extremely severe recession. We will need ongoing fiscal stimulus for a long time to come # insiders
Measuring # socialism is an interesting problem. One way of looking at it is compare government spending (fed, state and local) to GDP. In 2019 it was around 40% of GDP in the US, so arguably 40% socialist. But that doesn't include the regulatory burden.
Sorta. The USA though is special though because it's one of the very rare cases if a 1st world power that has a tax revenue far less than its GDP output. That implies we bring into little revenue over all. That can be corrected through, but it requires raising taxes on 1%
Time is money, so the GDP is unitless. The ratio should be in dollars or whatever the currency unit is.

You have a point, the units of GDP are spondolicks / year; debt is in spondolicks, giving, in the ratio, years. Perhaps the difficulty is that debt isn’t just a lump sum, it is money owed in time, some short term, some long, some discounted, but £/t -> debt / GDP is unitless.

So, while Juneteenth is definitely significant, why that date known as the end to slavery in the U.S. instead of Dec. 18? Not trying to be snarky. I really am curious.
However, if I remember my history correctly, slavery actually was still in effect in at least some of the border states not covered by the Emancipation Proclamation up until the official ratification and enactment of the 13th amendment to the Constitution on Dec. 18, 1865 (2/3)
Serious question that someone (perhaps a historian like @ KevinMKruse or @ TheTattooedProf ) can hopefully help me out with. I understand the significance of Juneteenth as a milestone mark in the abolition of slavery in the U.S. (1/3)
Actually, not a chance of an economic bounce by fall. Any one with half a brain is remaining at home while this virus continues to spread. Also, dig into the facts. You will see in GDP, Stocks, unemployment, household income, Trump continued Obama's trends. Facts actually matter
