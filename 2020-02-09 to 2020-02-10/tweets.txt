Right but Bernie also fumbled this morning. I think it was a Chuck Ross interview where he was talking about the economy and Ross said “but people like the economy” then Bernie went off the rails. He is a loose cannon at best
This is all you’ve got. You have nothing of substance. No real plan to improve the economy, education, jobs, etc. Bots are the internet. Real working class people don’t care about bots , likes, or retweets. You don’t like him. We get it. I didn’t even vote for him. I will now.
Who cares if society is being poisoned from the Top. The economy is NOT the most important factor.

The Sub-contract workers in Iraq, from countries such as Pakistan, India, and the Philippines were excited to get a monthly income of $300 or about $10 per day, because their economy is so poor that put them in the higher class of working people. But, the homes there are $30,000.
Pundits love to say how "dangerous" Pres. Bernie would be for billionaires and the economy and then in the same breath call him ineffectual. Which is it, pundits? Bernie's candidacy is great for highlighting how little pundits actually know about anything.
1. He was acquitted 2. We collect less in taxes, and generally only people holding their first ever job earn minimum wage 3. Our economy is thriving Enjoy your blackface Prime Minister
at 10% inflation, maybe it would be an issue. but at less than 1% - the economy is actually tell govt, business and ppl to borrow more and invest in the future. that we arent spending money on infrastructure is a crime against the future economy.
Uhhhh...I’m pretty sure the economy was at the bottom when Obama took over?
For the sake of our country yes! But to put the blame on this fraud who inherited a great economy from #44, no!
@ maddow Rachel, I hear Trump tout the economy constantly. What I don't hear is Democrats pushing back and saying it's Obama's economy that started back in 2010 and kept improving up till now. They have to pound him back every time and don't let up. Show the stats.
Democrats just look ridiculous pretending the economy is falling apart http://va.newsrepublic.net/s/YkUeRM
And delivering the best economy ever... lol.
Even though Bloomberg is a Republican, I’m seriously thinking of voting for him, bc I’m disappointed with how the Democrats don’t seem to get how to win. It’s the economy, stupid. They could get their social programs passed if they put them in context of the larger economy.
So basically if climate change apocalypse is real then people will become extinct, problem solved. And if it isn’t then there’s no reason for human extinction. Either way there’s no reason to ruin our economy to fund a Marxist take over to “boot strap” a climate change cure lol

Welcome to the job creator club. Now take a systems view of the economy and fight for a balanced budget, and as a business man, I hope you agree that “trickle up” is the nature of wealth and income in capitalism. That’s why we’ve always had progressive marginal income tax rates.

its not a BFD with a 20 trillion $ economy. think of your mortgage. you make 100K but are 300K in debt on the house. are you an idiot or a wise investor? since lots of the money is spent on medicare + social security = it goes right back into the spending economy
The economy is in bad shape. The fed is buying their own bonds to pump up th stock values. Debt is at record levels, Deficit spending is out of control, irresponsible and unsustainable. The U.S. natural resources and public lands are being sold to foreign entities.

Our political economy is such that we cannot even equitably share the benefits of growth. Because of this, I worry not only about the political possibilities of decentering growth, but the ultimate political economy of the winners and losers.
Nah they're socialist programs. Socialists want EVERY domain of the economy controlled. But in and of themselves, they're socialist programs. The government controls them, not the market. I'M NOT TALKKNG ABOUT THE WHOLE SYSTEM MEATHEAD. JUST THE SPECIFIC PROGRAMS.
Great add. The clip about the economy is also a good one. It was Obama who did the recovery.
Well you have to ask yourself who knows more about economy who knows about foreign policy who knows about America who gave more money in your pocket who built our military 2 standards. USA is the biggest exporter of oil not Reliant. What issues do the Dems have to stand on? None.
Lol you mean the economy Obama built and Trump shamelessly takes credit for, I’ll take my chances with the Dems, thanks.
Leo was used by the EU and went along with it. There even on video saying there gonna use Ireland to fuck up any negotiations so the only way to get back at the EU would have been through hitting the Irish economy with boycotts. Hopefully the new Taoiseach will have more sense
Tom Steyer is leading the conversation on the need to stop glorifying US militarism. Wars are not winnable on a battlefield in the 21st century. The trillions wasted on wars need to be invested in other areas to grow our economy & prosper as a nation. Steyer is shaping policy.
They are to the left of the two main parties in the republic on the economy, housing, healthcare, but that wouldn't be difficult. The Social Democrats are the closest thing to New Labour and their health proposals (Universal healthcare) are more radical than SF.

It would be a neat trick for a stock market not to grow in an economy that’s not in recession, where a government has an annual budget deficit of over $1,000,000,000,000 ... how long can THAT go on, and do those folks think they’ll cash out their 401k before it ends?
Like we are talking this uber-power that can make its owner do a little whatever the fuck they want. Just that everything around them suffer for it. Winning a lottery ticket ends with the local economy crashing etc etc.
Well this great economy hasn't changed my life in the least. I feel a recession will have the same.
This isn't rocket science how are we suppose to take on new comers aka political mass immigration when our economy is in the dump? Who going house all these people and feed them etc. Not to mention school class room sizes already.
Every time a GOP President is elected they screw up the economy by intentionally socializing our tax dollars and giving it to the people who don't even need it.

GeorgieBoy did wrong, no question. However methinks we're seeing another symptom of an economy that's slowing down. 1st thing to go will be fancy dinners out; those businesses will buckle under the strain. It's the start of a cascading failure. More to come.

NOT TRUE AT ALL! I’m a Middle AMERICAN and President Trump’s economy has benefited me and many others I know as well! Thank you, President Trump!
Bloomberg frankly has the best campaign. He’s making fun of Trump, which is how you handle a bully. He’s also calling Trump out for his lies on economy. It’s the economy, stupid. Meanwhile other candidates focus on forgiving student loan debt, when that doesn’t have broad appeal.
At some point deficit spending MUST STOP! What better time to reduce domestic spending than when the economy is great: wages up, more jobs than job seekers. NOW!
I support @ andrewyang because of the positive psychological impact I think his # freedomdividend could have on the economy. When some wages go to support "wants" like vacations, savings, college, repairs instead of basic needs people should be happier and willing to work more.
Who’s recession? The successes of this economy are built on 8 years of the previous Democrat in the White House. Trump maybe laying the groundwork for his own recession. In that case, get him out!
Even more don't h Understand the economy. Throwing up the stock market when it hits a high doesn't mean a good economy.
The green new deal could be amazing for Americas economy. Right now industry in America is drowning in what's called technical debt. The innovations coming on right now could allow a green nanoindustrial revolution to happen with just a little support from the government.

trump’s policy of pumping money into the economy is not sustainable.
The collapse of our economy would accelerate with history proven failed policies implemented by Socialist Dem leadership. Unsustainable spending programs with no rapid return or any return would require a money supply increase & rising interest rates would further slow investment
Yup, cause unlike rich.. poor will put 99% of it back into the economy.
Give me the name of an economist who says this is the best economy ever? Obama had over 3% growth in several quarters. His unemployment rate dropped faster and his job creation was greater. Take a look at the Clinton economy in the 90’s & post-war growth rates. He’s ridiculous.
Keynes advocated government intervention to stabilize the national economy and was a big favorite of FDR during the Depression. Needless to say, his policies didn't work.

That boom happened in part thanks to the GI bill. Taxes went up to 90% during that time. There was an effective salary cap. And ... as you said, the economy was booming. Technically it didn't shrink either, the GDP grew, dwarfing the effect of the debt.

Been playing on an economy minecraft server and I found a road and I've been following this road for maybe an hour now finding base along the way
March 2020: Bloomberg announces he will increasing campaign spending tenfold. April 2020: Unemployment rate goes down to 0.2%, experts baffled. November 2020: Trump reelected due to strength of economy and a spoiler from 16% write-ins to Bloomberg over the Dem candidate Sanders.
Very true. But, so many glaze over & tout the economy. I think we need a very careful balance between policy discussions & giving them a reason to want them all out of office that outweighs their pockets.

When Trump says this is the best economy ever, with those rates it’s definitely not the working class he’s talking about.
1) Trump, the unhinged has: Lowered taxes given us the best economy in forever lowest unemployment in 50 years helped us gain 6,000,000 new jobs 600,000 manufacturing jobs that Obama said we'd never have https://twitter.com/g_semans/status/1226030116284829697 …
Deficit reduction didn't reduce unemployment, other common factors both increased employment and reduced deficits. Cutting government spending slows down the economy, increases unemployment, and causes the kind of dysfunction we're seeing after austerity policies in Europe
Bloomberg would actually be the best choice for you guys. Pitch him as a more toned down version of Trump who knows how to continue to boost the economy. Foreign leaders won’t respect anyone else, but you clowns can’t recognize that.

Everything mentioned in the article is correct. Being an economist also, I’m terrified of the Centralization of the economy by Bernie or any of the Dem front runners. The smart money would begin bailing out of our economy even before the # Dems attained control of the White House.

The Obama Administration helped Bailout financial institutions & other sections in OUR economy. It was the worst Recession since the great Depression. It spent Trillions to do it. The Trump Administration has spent Trillions on Defense & the Tax Cuts. Which has helped US more?
That's the thing that media ignores. Trump inherited the Obama economy with strong positive momentum. But under traitor Trump those trend lines are all slowing down. If tyrant Trump gets a second term, there will be a recession. # ObamaOutdidTrump # TrumpIsNotFitForOffice # VoteBlue
Not at all surprised; as a social media influencer, you could make or break the Cypriot economy!
Private debt exploded. It was a bubble economy (followed by an even worse bubble economy in the 2000s), and left us far worse off.
Trust me, Northern Italy has many more reasons to become independent from Italy than Scotland from England. The level of oppression is much greater, as the unbearable taxation from the Italian government is greatly inhibiting our economy, which is now close to being in recession.

This is an absurd take. The economy is already slowing down. If he gets re-elected, there’s still going to be a slowdown, if not a recession. Scare tactics like this are idiotic.
One of the most depressing things to me is, how can any rational person be against president Trump at this point. For the love of God, he's given us the best economy we've seen since the 60s and lifted millions of minorities out of poverty.

The Fed has pumped $500 billion into the economy in the last few months to prop it up. The first time since 2008. And much more. It didn't work. We only had 2.3% growth in 2019. Manufacturing is at its lowest level in a decade. The jobs numbers are the worst in eight years.
Actually their average age is rising steadily. It is expected that over a third of the population will be over 65 within the next decade. And, more to the point, a stable society needs people in the 30 to 50 age range to build, manage, grow the economy.

Why is it so hard for democrats to get behind a president who simply wants to put America first? Supports our military & law enforcement. Has given us a booming economy. Record low minority unemployment. Better trade deals. Has brought back jobs Obama said were gone forever.
And by the way, look at the situation from a macro point of view. Think in terms of total economy, and you can see that the scheme targets only the saver. Those savers should be protected and their money should not stay under the hands of Salameh & his cronies.
I couldn’t possibly disagree with you more. If you’re willing to vote for this socialist/communist over our current economy you lack the basic understanding of economics.
Inherited what from who? Liberals are good at blaming others when things are going bad and want to take credit when things are going good. If you are talking about Obama he was terrible and was only good at spending money. Knew nothing about economy.
How is the economy great with the federal debt is accelerating and it’s not like America is at war...how is the debt climbing, and Americans paying the tariffs and the government giving bail outs to the manufacturing and agricultural industry not a recession.
They absolutely drive wages down, putting more Americans on social assistance as well as lowering their taxes as a result. That’s in addition to the direct costs. The suggestion they are a net benefit to the economy is nonsense.
I prefer a great economy & less money going to corrupt foreign governments . # trump2020
gig economy offers no PTO
I understand that you fish, and fishing is important to you and you’ve likely voted because you’ve been guaranteed certain things. However, in the context of the UK economy, fishing is relatively insignificant, and this is the position it will take in Brexit negotiations.
I want radical change too I just don't want to get there overnight. It will lead to too much fear and instability in society and our economy. We can't go from a capitalist to a democratic socialist system at the flip of a switch. # Election2020 # ElizabethWarren # Bernie2020

One of Yang's points is that economy is so developed that we need to change our collective mindset about our role in it. Unrealistic to expect to educate everyone for the "jobs of the future." We can try to do that, but it is time to turn progress into freedom.
Good thing for me since I've voted Libertarian for nearly 25yrs now... Both parties are sheepish. The Dems more so though. To be a Dem today you have to be willing to set aside Reason and Truth and believe in Lies and Sophistry. At least, Trump's sheep have a booming economy.
@ ObsoleteDogma @ ddayen Except, running a trillion dollar deficit during a time of low unemployment also displays a deep economic illiteracy. This is when you’re SUPPOSED to pay down the debt, not run it up further. Are we really suggesting continued $1T deficits?
He wants to raise taxes progressively to contain the growth of debt. As the taxes will be sharply progressive and the resultant redistribution should raise MPC, why would that increase the unemployment rate. Please explain. It would leave more fiscal room to deal with a recession
More people working, lowest unemployment in 50 years, many women working, more women graduates, poc lowest unemployment. you call this darkest of times? Isis destroyed , no racial riots , no major wars, technology great, air and water clean. We have it good. MAGA.
He claims he is responsible for the decrease in unemployment among Blacks & Hispanics. They will believe it if the Dems. don't hit back. This is the only thing Trump has going for him. They have to take that away. But I don't hear it. My wife and I watch your show a lot.
"The strikes have halted the upturn in growth that had set unemployment on a downward trend for the first time in more than a decade."
Lowest black unemployment rate because Obama's policys, the African Americans are finishing up their trade schools and collage programs and are still working Millions off food stamps... Well sure he kicked them off.
His son’s mother was on welfare while he was stealing food from his neighbors & collecting unemployment until he was elected Mayor.

It's interesting to Democratic candidates all say we have to beat Trump but they don't exactly say why other than some abstract idea like he's a racist or immoral unfit or even dangerous but it's not for the lowest unemployment numbers or over 7 million new jobs created a booming
Let's see....lowest unemployment across all demographics, highest stock market, fixing trade imbalance with China, securing borders to prevent another 9/11, strengthening military. Your accomplishments; didn't break a nail today
More jobs than people. 13 million more people working paying in to the system 8 million less on welfare taking from the system. Historic levels minority unemployment. No new wars while trying to scale back those remaining from previous administration. Sucks much
@ RashidaTlaib why would people who are off unemployment and going to work need food assistance? How did such an ignoramist end up in Congress? Don't forget, President Trump was AQUITED FOREVER motherf'er
When in doubt, trot out the “Trump is Racist” line despite lowest black unemployment in US history and 7 MILLION fewer people on If Trump is a racist, he’s a really bad one.
Indeed, but it is helpful to remind that what actually made the Clinton successful was not so great. Rather, the sources of growth (the private sector credit bubble) led to deficit reduction and low unemployment.
Really?? Sort our mess out first gov has brought in Cuban engineers when our own engineers are sitting at home without jobs Unemployment is at its highest and private companies closing down daily causing more job losses BUT we don't hear from our President Sad!
So yes, it is “someone else’s fault”, unemployment is a planned element of our economic system. Take a moment to step back and see the whole, instead of getting your jollies by judging the individuals who are collateral.
But yet here we are with record unemployment, an economy that consistently outpaces forecasts, and a pretty strong stock market.... if that’s run into the ground, I’d love to see your definition of success. Good talk... bro.
Those people who were on food stamps now have jobs. That is a good thing. If they didn’t we wouldn’t have a 3.5% unemployment. It’s good they had to get jobs. There are still people on food stamps and have jobs and that is ok too. The good thing is they work.
This is what I’m talking about. Unemployment numbers are low when average Americans are working at least 2 jobs just to cover the rising costs of living. There is a huge gap. https://apple.news/ADMxQm4mfR5iZDLIAniGuvw …
Can I assume that you’re not a fan of low unemployment, high consumer satisfaction, moving the US embassy, pushing back against China and other corrupt governments and raising middle class wages?
Give me the name of an economist who says this is the best economy ever? Obama had over 3% growth in several quarters. His unemployment rate dropped faster and his job creation was greater. Take a look at the Clinton economy in the 90’s & post-war growth rates. He’s ridiculous.
If we finished unemployment nobody can hack the youngsters to do paid crime
Unemployment always looks better. At first. Lol
In finance, 3 weeks is French for unemployment.

Wow...if freeing the American people with less regulation and lower taxes, bringing people back to workforce after unemployed for more than a yr, lowered unemployment and increased wages, stood up to other countries unfair practices to US workers....if that is Dictator..more more

By doing what? Killing small businesses? Taxing the hell out of them, and fining those who couldn't afford Obamacare. Let's not forget he is also the one who bailed out Wall Street,and Detroit. We had an unemployment rate of 10% at its highest. Yeah, that's very helpful.
But he didn’t say he was taking them away. He said “jobs are up, unemployment is down and food stamp recipients are down”
I've looked and looked. All I see is sad memes that are easily refuted. We have record low unemployment, approaching full employment, rising wages, highest growth... Again explain
March 2020: Bloomberg announces he will increasing campaign spending tenfold. April 2020: Unemployment rate goes down to 0.2%, experts baffled. November 2020: Trump reelected due to strength of economy and a spoiler from 16% write-ins to Bloomberg over the Dem candidate Sanders.
What does that have to do with the unemployment rate? Also I’m in the miltary and have a bachelors so I picked my path and don’t tell us how to move

Lol gdp per capita. You have 1.3 bn ppl to feed. What’s your youth unemployment like? Good luck loser
Deficit reduction didn't reduce unemployment, other common factors both increased employment and reduced deficits. Cutting government spending slows down the economy, increases unemployment, and causes the kind of dysfunction we're seeing after austerity policies in Europe
That’s not at all how that works. Federal Unemployment (numbers) are based on people pulling unemployment benefits not on who has jobs. What could be the case is people leaving the job market and not collecting unemployment thus lowering the number.
That’s because they could not afford good lawyers. Now that black unemployment is at its lowest in history and wages are rising this will change!
For context... can you document WHAT obummer is saying at that point? He likely isnt saying lowest unemployment for minorities, youth etc. Or latest jobs and stock market reports. Probably taking about his horrible still flawed HC plan. Context is relevant. They didnt tear it up
My kinda clown. 225,000 JOBS, JOBS. "The unemployment rate ticked HIGHER to 3.6%, but for the right reason as the labor force participation rate INCREASED 0.2 percentage points to 63.4%, matching its highest level since June 2013." https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/02/07/us-nonfarm-payrolls-january-2019.html?__twitter_impression=true …
The media definitely hasn't succeeded in making him look worse this time & the economy's doing phenomenally, with historic low unemployment rates for minority communities. So expect those # s to be higher this year.
That would be a great way to increase unemployment!
We also rely heavily on unskilled immigration in an economy where job vacancies are rising, employment going up, and unemployment declining. We need an open, liberal immigration system, one that prioritises our economy, and one that helps people integrate into British society. https://twitter.com/Liberal_Tory/status/1226509479539281921 …

Small price!?!?! We have a great economy, a HISTORICALLY LOW unemployment rate especially for minorities! People's 401k's are doing great, 2 great new Supreme Court Justices, and trying to secure our border without any help from democrats... Trump's doing a great job!
The record lowest unemployment is actually what majority of poor are enjoying. Only enemy spies desperately try to ignore or deny the facts and make chaos because they are scared of their future in Trump's administration. Their days are counted.
I’m sorry Juliet. You are wrong. What’s wrong with a POTUS who puts America first? Unemployment down, stock market is up. What’s wrong with any of that?
Didn’t we reduce the deficit and unemployment at the same time in the 90s?
I don’t know the statistics cited, but I DO know this. Unemployment is down bc the same people are working 2 & 3 jobs to make ends meet. Trump doesn’t care about the average person or hourly pay rate. He cares about protecting corporations from having to pay people a living wage.
1) Yes. Most people graduate from high school. My dad had to drop out in the 1940s to support his family. That is very rare these days. 2) Yes. Unemployment is near record lows. 3) Yes. 4) Yes. Barring disabilities or severe circumstances, these are achievable and controllable.
WOW things sucked under Obama in 2013 as well. Todays' unemployment is lower than any month under Obama's last 4 years in office!
EFF politics aside, we are in real shit.. 10million unemployment, poor black souls who I'm sure many are still awake and depressed.. while most of minorities are snoring and will wake up ngo 6am go to work business as usual.. Nxaa! Not fair
Yeah. Love increasing the deficit. Really love reducing Medicare and social security. Ooh, the fact Obama reduces unemployment more than trump. Oh, and love how trump had set with porn stars while married. Man, he’s awesome!!!!

I dislike how the polls calculate unemployment. All you have to do is have a part time job to be considered Conditioned Employed that reflects a positive mark on employment. Doesn't take into effect wage, if it's a liveable wage at that. Needs to be revamped

See you have never visited this community. Been working since I was 10 yrs old and have never seen the inside of an unemployment office. You are definitely clueless.

So Julius is supposed to be the man whom we need to fight poverty and unemployment according to the initial tweet?
Insults in politics have happened, sure. Nothing on this level. Trump wants the groupthink mentality which will surround himself with yes men. Obviously I’ve been paying attention because I see right through his claims (economy, unemployment, etc). He just hasn’t F’d it up yet.
Micro measures. It doesn’t matter if unemployment overall is 5%, it matters that its stuck at 10% in your town.
You constantly bash him for everything. He’s tearing apart the swamp and all the media and people like you want to bash him. Lowest unemployment rate in history. Lowest black unemployment rate in history. Fixed the trade deals. Made the call to kill salami!!! Cut taxes.
With unemployment cost of living is higher, so POC are having to work multiple jobs to stay a float. However the First Step Act was not just passed it was a bill passed into law by Obama with Trump adding onto it calling it his own
Why is it so hard for democrats to get behind a president who simply wants to put America first? Supports our military & law enforcement. Has given us a booming economy. Record low minority unemployment. Better trade deals. Has brought back jobs Obama said were gone forever.
Oh well tell me where a supermarket is that they are attacking? I'm serious because I have never seen anyone in my community even acknowledge a different color. You are sick and divisive. Black unemployment up. Dems talking about Black voters like they own slaves at debates.
seems to be major flaw here ... did you realize that as unemployment gets lower it is exponentially more difficult to bring it down more? ... and i know this will come as shock ... but obama stated on national tv that reaching this point in economy impossible ... go figure
I doubt you’d have to wait 10 years to see results. Look what Trump’s done for black unemployment in 3 years. If blacks turned R at the very least D’s would be forced to rethink their insulting, ineffective “you’re a victim and don’t you forget it” garbage.
Honoring the Tuskegee airman was bigoted? Low unemployment is a lie? People not needing food stamps is undignified? What am I missing?
President Trump has delivered the lowest black unemployment rate in the history of the United States (Democrats say this is proof Trump is a pandering racist. Good lord liberals logic hurts my head!)

They keep telling us they knew what they were voting for, so I guess unemployment must be the will of the people.
Record number of unemployment=less people needing to be on food stamps. POTUS=GOAT. Where are you from anyway. It's certainly not here. Ballot boxes must have been stuffed to get you in office. Only way evil people like you can win.
I honestly don't get the complaints of the right. Lowest unemployment, highest growth in decades, but Conservatives claim he's the most divisive... Exactly how is he divisive?
So, according to you, bringing unemployment from 10% to 4% is worse than bringing it from 4% to 3%. # MAGAts are the true geniuses of today. Seriously.

Hours that people work, there will be unemployment. And regardless, companies are going to be unable to pay workers they need when people are not getting the jobs they need. Very soon we will have way more people than we have need for people to work. UBI ensures everyone eats.

I said “record low unemployment” under Trump. You provided a graph that shows record low unemployment under Trump. Your graph does not any any way shape form or interpretation counter what I said. You built a straw man in your head of what you thought I said and hit that. Fail.
I’m assuming it does considering the record unemployment rates. More people working = less people needing those benefits = less money needed for them, hence the cuts.
I remember hearing someone say that the reason the unemployment numbers are falling is due to the stagnant growth of new jobs being added to the economy and that it's a misleading statistic. Out here, we have businesses closing... that's not a sign of a booming economy.
Best economy and unemployment rates for almost a century. President Trump will go down in history as one of the USs best ever presidents. Add to that his stance on illegals, world politics, etc, etc, and he's a winner.
Trump has gotten the lowest Black unemployment in History Of USA
No I am definitely and reality it's snowflake people like you and the others who doesn't see the big picture obviously you and the democrats don't want us to have a good economy or low unemployment rates
When he became president the economy was crashing. Stock market almost tripled during his term. Unemployment was cut on half during his term. Last 35 months of obama produced millions more jobs than trumps first 35 months
Once joined a $5 flex league. For $5/week, you could bowl 3 games each day whenever you wanted. A real unemployment special.

Their unemployment level is much higher.
They hide because, if they had an employer like me who saw them marching in this Nazi fest, they'd be marching their ass down to the unemployment line.
Didn’t Obama derastically reduce unemployment? Did it stop the alt right from growing?
He’s our President, and you can thank him for record low unemployment, rising wages, and a booming economy. Trade deals, decimating ISIS, and prison reform. Prepare yourself - but I think he will be re-elected.
Ask trump. He walked by, put in the last piece of a 1000 piece puzzle, and claimed to have "finished a 1000 piece puzzle. Eg: trump on black unemployment. Claims he's done more for blacks than anyone since black unemployment is at all time low. In reality he only got it down 1%.
America Donald Trump is beating his chest about the economy being great,and unemployment being low, but what doesn’t tell is that wages have not gone up at all and Blacks unemployment remains in double digits.
I'd rather have them on unemployment premiums.
In Australia, since the 1970s, the official unemployment rate has been between 4% and 10%. Governments gauge this stat in a way that minimises it. Every government since the 70s has failed to solve this problem, and you think it’s the unemployed person’s fault?
Facts don’t care about your feelings. The record economy is under trump, lowest unemployment, most job growth and record stock market. These are facts not your opinions

Unemployment. Economic slowdown. Why there is no exam of NTPC till now????
Pic is from Wikipedia, not necessarily from proponents of MMT. It really sounds much more like a straw man to me. Just because the "level of taxation relative to government spending" is "a policy tool that regulates inflation and unemployment" doesn't mean they can do whatever.
Record low unemployment. Record high employment. Wages on the rise. All you can do is screw it up.
The unemployment and growth figures ARE true, unless you're a conspiracy fan. Trump's approval ratings are rising because the familues can feel it in their income. They can see the construction all around, after a decade of kids not knowing what construction looked like.

My favorite is that unemployment fell under Obama. You do realize a fact is that under the “new” method of calculating unemployment only figures people who were ACTIVELY looking for work. So many people just gave up looking for a job. Those people dropped off. U lose. Again.
For taking these steps to modernize our unemployment insurance systemLIVE: President Obama is delivering remarks at the Invictus Games today with my friend Joe.
Douche Todd (or is it Chuck?) in an interview with Bernie Sanders said “...on its surface, [the economy] looks pretty good to quite a few people. This is a fairly low unemployment rate...” Unbelievable, but believable. NBC-nothin’ but crap
Question was: "Does Donald Trump do better or worse than Obama regarding unemployment numbers" So? Still waiting,
Obama’s American Recovery and Reinvestment Act created jobs through “public works,” with most jobs being in construction. This scheme reduced the unemployment rate, but Obama increased the debt by 74%, or $8.6 trillion! That drove the debt-to-GDP ratio to a record 104 percent!

The unemployment rate is a poor reflection of the state of things here. Many have fallen off of unemployment or no longer seek work because they have given up. Or we are taking 2-3 jobs just to make it.

Yes if the Dems can convince the public that the econ isn’t booming, that manufacturing isn’t returning, that we don’t have historically low unemployment, they’re in business. Maybe they can bring in the Russian angle again. It’s going to be fun to watch.
Unemployment was up again. It appears we’re transitioning from Obama’s economy to yours.
And it clearly shows record low unemployment under Trump. Are you dense?
If you served the country, you would have supported the President that was elected by voters. But you felt superior to them. You wanted to substitute your own opinions for what voters wanted. You deserve unemployment.
Under Obama, the average unemployment rate was 7.7% Under Trump, it's never risen above 4%
Without EU it would be 60% youth unemployment and overall 30% unemployment. Portugal economy did not struggled , it only slow a little bit after joining the Euro , but the benefits of joining the Euro was well worthy.
Further gdp per Capita France $21k less than US in 2017 Constant Dollars. They have 8.5% unemployment as well. Don’t even get me started on Median Wealth per adult.
Trump is NOT a politician hence his demeanor. Look at his accomplishments to dtd. 7 million new jobs, 10,000 folks off welfare. 500,000 manufacturing jobs. Lowest unemployment in 48.6 years. Give that thought.
You're dodging the question. Your claim was "Record low unemployment". I posted the statistics from TRUMP's bureau of labor statistics, no cherry picking at all. So? Waiting.

The unemployment rate right now is actually probably too low. Workers are employed, but not prospering. There's a lot the administration isn't doing to influence growth in a sustainable way. Obama did the hard work; Trump reaps the rewards.
So under a Democratic president for 8 years unemployment was higher then it is under the trump administration. Please explain your thinking and show your work.

Simple question. What about Trump's performance do you reject. Jobs, wages, unemployment numbers, stock market, trade, border security war on terror, what? How do you propose to improve upon Trump's performance? You pathetic little man, you hate Trump more than you love America.
It makes me feel guilty, were on unemployment atm and get paid every 2 weeks. I can chip in next week.
Says the economics degree holder that believes "unemployment is low because people work multiple jobs"
Lies, each an every one.. Hurts to see a video like this doesn't it? Hurts to see the democrats hatred and disdain for military widows, sick children, low unemployment, low poverty rate put together so neatly for everyone to see? No victims for Liberals to prey on, huh? :(

WOW what a revelation! Is this true? Come on people get real. I think it’s much higher %. When has stats ever been over rated? Like when they tell you about unemployment but don’t include welfare recipients. Stop illegal entry of any kind.
Was he lying in SOTU about unemployment rates with minorities? Was he lying about unemployment rate for women? How about the Veterans unemployment? You like Obama - did Trump lie about people coming off Food Stamps?

4. on the economy, yes the stock market is up and unemployment is down - big whoop ... most Americans don't have enough stock to care about the market; we added jobs - ok, what KIND? If we add 20,000 low-skill, minimum wage jobs, is that considered 'economic growth?' ...

You know that your lies & exaggerations don't deflect from the strong military, amazing economy, fabulous opportunities for ALL and historic wage increase & low unemployment among all working Americans, right? https://www.docdroid.net/KDaSuMo/trumpaccomplishments.pdf …
Question for you though, what was the unemployment rate towards the end of Obama’s reign?
Yes, the unemployment rate is historic low. Trump decreased it (further) by 1,1% (it's 3,6%). Great but no miracle. At the same time he's ballooning the deficit with no recession. All in all it looks like short term solutions. Hopefully it will not end up in a recession. pic.twitter.com/HEgbuKyET2
No, I did not. Keynesian ecomonics said high unemployment together with high interest rates (stagflation) was IMPOSSIBLE. Friedman later came up with a theory which at least plausibly explained it. But the Keynesians? Not a chance.
The job creation and unemployment re incontrovertible.
You’re a liar. Record unemployment for AA, Hispanics, women is not a lie. ISIS is gone is not a lie, record GDP is not a lie, Record Dow is not a lie.
Yep. But his followers will say it doesn't matter because the stock market is up and unemployment is down. Therefore Trump destroying our financial future is (apparently) irrelevant.
So having strong economy affects my life negatively? Sorry but low unemployment rate and growing economy points to great things for most Canadians. Add the fact that Canada consistently ranked #1 in quality of the life If you can't understand that, then you're truly tone deaf
Low employment rate is rigged. Tightened restrictions on Unemployment benefits. Wages stagnant; GOP vote down wage increase, People working 2 or more low paying and/or part-time jobs. They scalped the taxpayer treasury Taxcuts 4 rich & want MC and poor to cover their deficit.

You have it very wrong. Obama gave them ACA or allowed them to stay on parents Insurance till 26yrs. extended unemployment benefits at least 3x. They became a dependent of the state. Oh and and free cell phones. Not a damn responsibility.
teachers' low salaries are not the fault of baseball players, just as unemployment in California is not the fault of immigrants. Trying to differentiate yourself from trump, you're looking a lot like him. Stop populism!

Ok - this is where you are lost in your own vacuum chamber of thought - Obama DID inherit a crisis from GWB. Unemployment was at high end of 11%. But, Obama never got GDP > 3%. Trump enacted reform like cutting regulations and corporate tax cuts to halt Obama Era inversions...

You have a point but what if the next could be worse? At least the man is not looting state coffers. Who are his advisers? They might be sabotaging him somehow. I mean closing borders would be the first advice. The rest we work together as for unemployment.lets give him some time
The pundits & Media like @ CNN @ CNNPolitics @ MSNBC need to stop saying that the economy is doing so well. It isn’t & it shows. It’s been manipulated by the stock market & low unemployment # s but no one suspects that this lying Admin is actually cooking the books! FYI @ TeamPelosi
I'd like someone who supported Obama to give me one tangible thing Obama did to help the black community. Just one significant thing. Trump passed prison reform, wages rising, unemployment down, prioritized funding for historically black unis- what did Obama do besides use them?
You are obviously not well informed or ill informed, you really need to check your sources. We are in the best economy for the last 50 years, unemployment across the board setting records, wages have increased over 3%, which hasn't been seen since the early 2000's.
Unemployment is pretty low in British Columbia, so easier to find a job. Quebec has fairly high unemployment, but lower cost of living. The bigger cities have nearly ridiculous prices for housing, and food is expensive too.
Why exactly should we continue running a deficit during an economic expansion? The unemployment rate is below 4%. The economy doesn’t need fiscal stimulus.
You personally doing great for country but need your level in each state, at local body . That us the only way we can clean up country for all mess, corruption, all special favors , social issues , poverty , reduce unemployment
If you don't like Trump, then you are AGAINST a better economy including low unemployment, higher wages & lower taxes, a safer America, destruction of terrorists, protection for babies & veterans, Christians, removal of illegals who break our laws, etc. Mind Boggling! # KAG2020
@ KevinPMeagher on # MOATS “Although Ireland has got a very fast growing economy and very low unemployment there are big issues in terms of quality of life, in terms of health services, homelessness and particularly the cost of housing have become massive issues in this campaign.” pic.twitter.com/keBIjpVskg
Trump is fit for office! 7 million new jobs. 12 thousand new factories Lowest unemployment rate for blacks, Hispanics and Asians ever 72% of new jobs filled by women 10 million off of welfare 5 million off of food stamps Immigration down 70%+ # 4MoreYears # TrumpNotFitForOfficepic.twitter.com/MRBTMQyo5W
You really need an explanation on why who’s responsible for the decline is important? Giving trump credit for the decline in unemployment is like giving a junior high school student credit for coming up with the theory of relativity.
I'll support any man who can lower unemployment past the 50 year mark, get 4 million Americans of food stamps, employ more minorities and women than any other before him and who has more women in executive positions than past Presidents.

Ignore? Under Obama-Biden more black and brown people appointed to the bench. Black unemployment dropped from 16.7% to 7.7%, we opened more businesses, 4 billion allocated to black colleges, more of us went to college, received more aid for tuition. Less of us were incarcerated l

A Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis study in February 2008 on the economic impact of a pandemic similar to the 1918 flu pandemic, estimated that U.S. GDP could fall as much as 5.5%. China's GDP decline could be even greater which could lead to a severe global recession.

It is 1.89 (UK) and 1.83% (Scotland) of GDP.
That boom happened in part thanks to the GI bill. Taxes went up to 90% during that time. There was an effective salary cap. And ... as you said, the economy was booming. Technically it didn't shrink either, the GDP grew, dwarfing the effect of the debt.
Actually their policies are moronic. When the GDP is 22 trillion, can anyone explain about how we are supposed to spend 95 trillion? Why would anyone take economic advisers from a bartender? Every economist or accountant I've met was a conservative
That’s not true. Defence in UK as a percentage of GDP is 1.89%, in Scotland it’s 1.83%. Are you conflating a share of spending with a share of GDP? https://youtu.be/HWqmsNp9334

We pay twice up to twice as much as other wealthy nations. Whether it’s taxes or in premiums, copays, deductibles, out of networks, it’s irrelevant. 17% of GDP goes to healthcare. The world average is 10%. This is an idiotic false premise. We are already paying for it.
If that’s the case why does Trump continue to tout that the economy has risen under him? Housing prices, underemployment, increases in taxes for the middle class, and increases in healthcare prices is shrinking the GDP and the middle class

since a good part of debt/liabilities are in local currency, their real dollar value will shrink along with the Lira depreciation. But GDP will certainly plummet, perhaps even faster than the currency, so the debt-to-GDP ratio will not improve.

Wages are up more than anytime in the last 15 years. GDP growth continues to be over 2%.
"...So why would we tie ourselves to EU rules for the 90% of our gdp that isn't related to eu exports?" That implies you are staying that all our GDP is exports. If that's not what you mean, you should reword
The USA alone has a gdp a third larger than the EU27. Add in Canada and Mexico and it's not far off 50% larger. The government is fully accountable at the ballot box. The EU commission is not. I prefer my policies to be made by accountable politicians.

I agree that viewing from all angles is always best, but two follow-ups: 1. Rates. Did you look at what it costs to service those debts. I.E. Personal auto loan rates have declined ~3% since 2007. 2. Why compare to GDP and not disposable personal income?

Now you’re following. This isn’t a partisan thing, it’s simply about whether taking credit for a record expansion is credible. Whether we’re talking GWBush or Obama or Trump, we have to decrement GDP stats if 2 or 4 or 6% of econ activity can be tracked back to deficit spending
You're making the assumption that 100% of our GDP is exports. It's not. Most of our exports go to the EU. Of which, they make 10% of our GDP. Hope that helps.

Hmm… so UK exports to non-EU countries make up about 90% of our GDP, and yet, going by your Femi-logic you want the UK hogtied to the EU for 10% Economics is not your strong point eh!
Based on the way Asian currencies are leaning, I'm going to guess /ES will gap up. (Of course, I could be wrong.) Perhaps manufacturers of masks and gowns will stimulate GDP.

Now do assets as a % of GDP
I'm pretty sure life today is much better than life in the 60's. US debt by a % of GDP fell dramatically after the New Deal. It didn't start going up dramatically until the most recent recession.
The GDP per capita advantage will persist for a long time. But no longer being the source of the most exciting new products, media, etc, will take its toll on perception.

2 things, Medicare for all costs the American people less than the current system, 2-5 trillion dollars according to the heritage foundation which is in no way left wing, and GDP is not at all a good measure of the US economy. All it tells you is how good the rich are doing.
Omg are you literally this stupid? Of course you have a higher GDP, you're 80m people. And that's GDP PPP, your actual GDP is $813.810bn. Germany's is $3.677 trillion! Same population, nearly 5 times bigger. Dream on about being on the same level.
First and foremost, the economic impact of these shutdowns will be monumental. China's growth depends heavily on its industry, and to shut down a large portion of its manufacturing capacity is bound to absolutely destroy their GDP numbers that they so preciously value.
Gone are the Days of GDP, GNP and GNI as indicators for economic growth. Citizens should all watch out for poverty rates, inequality, education, health and freedom as significant economic barometers. Don't be misinformed: be economically vigilant.
Obama’s American Recovery and Reinvestment Act created jobs through “public works,” with most jobs being in construction. This scheme reduced the unemployment rate, but Obama increased the debt by 74%, or $8.6 trillion! That drove the debt-to-GDP ratio to a record 104 percent!
4.6% and it's not really significant. 2% of GDP on a deficit over 5 years is not even moving the needle. A recession would send the deficit to 10% of GDP in no time.

Higher taxes and less gov spending will significantly impact gdp and economic activity,unless other sources of income (ie positive current account) are available. The FED is, IMHO, just backstopping the government’s need to finance the immense current account deficit.

I would submit that 22 trillion dollars deficit ,paying an annual interest of 350 Billion is unsustainable. And that when that we hit 175% of our debt to GDP ratio . Almost all social programs will completely be shut down. This is the hardship I fear for our people.
We are alarmed when GDP per capita or life expectancy decreases, but we don’t know when to be alarmed about the rate of moral progress. We know that morality has been progressing, but are we generating moral knowledge at the same pace as we are generating scientific knowledge?

Also, if you compare the effective tax rate of the top 1 percent in say 1952 (a bit over 43%), to that of 2018 (27.1%), that means that group would be paying 60% more in taxes than today, and the economy did considerably better than today in GDP growth.
The FD. Paying for it with a highly efficient self enforcing consumption tax like a value added tax is a very forward thinking way of finding a Ubi / citizens dividend. Because the dividend will be a function of GDP which is always going up.

If it's not relevant, why did @ Femi_Sorry mention it? It's still the case that it makes no sense to bind 90% of our gdp to rules for the 10% with the EU. Especially when more than that is dependent on trade outside the EU.
