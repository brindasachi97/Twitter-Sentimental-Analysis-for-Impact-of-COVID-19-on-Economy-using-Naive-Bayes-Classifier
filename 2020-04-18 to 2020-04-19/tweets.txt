Do you remember the economy he inherited from the Republican who tried to block every bill he tried to pass in Congress? On Trump's best day he can't be quarter of the man Obama was on his worst day. If Obama had the disposition this man has we'd never hear the end of it.

This doesn't make any sense. Currently, the rich are working from home and the poor are risking their lives at "essential jobs." A re-opened economy during pandemic: rich work from home, the poor risk their lives at non-essential jobs.
People do that. For fucks sake, labor creates all wealth, there is no magical economy that does a god damn thing.

My post was about the bullshit justifications for throwing food away. This is my POV. I did not mention economy. It is irrelevant when people are starving. If you feel differently, have at it, on your own post.
If they had acted by lockdown of our borders and testing along with putting alerts out to medical institutions to watch out for it. Life wouldn’t have been lost protecting the population protects jobs and the economy. But no that’s to hard for the tories
Trump has made a mess of things right from the start. Then you add in the fact he wants the people to die for the economy. I wouldn't let anyone from the States across the border
Even though our country was in great shape before this virus began, we are dealing with a whole different game now. The feds have injected trillions of dollars into our economy.They have lowered interest rates to zero. We’ve got a whole different game going here.
Testing is the new talking point of the left as to why we can’t open the economy. Testing is overrated. We are good to go RIGHT NOW

Ok Mr. Trump, we all agree on this, but there's no way in hell to change whats happened. The best we can do is destroy China's ability to try controlling the world--basically crash their economy to post WW2 levels and remove their failed leaders
Delaying payments for six months is not the same as cancelling the debt entirely. It is NOT good for the economy to teach children that they don’t have to be financially responsible.
I'm worried that unless we change our habits, these people will keep paying the price each time something like this happens. We need to start planning for a more resilient economy. This one failed us badly.

The Chinese government are liars, but so are the Dems. This is a never let a crisis go to waste situation, and the Dems are happy to hope for deaths, a market crash and destruction of the economy to bust on Trump. And to bring all that about as best as they can.
Uhhh... 12k deaths over a years time vs almost 40k over 3 months. Economy actually grew a little then, no quarantine, nothing shutdown, no hospitals were overwhelmed. Why? Because the people had faith in their leader.

He knows the economy has already tanked because they failed to balance public health and economic health. So It appears hes using the middle class to put pressure on states that in his nonmedical opinion are taking too long to open back up.
I dug into that concept and fell into a rabbit hole. Spent time instead counting the percentage of our economy fighting The War on DRUGS. Both great projects.
The impact of closing down the economy is so massive that it's impossible to even imagine all the implications.

Somehow I feel that all the damage to the economy could have been avoided with a strict 24hrs lockdown for 3 weeks. Once outbreaks were identified, traced and isolated throughout the USA, the rest of the people may have returned to normal.
To some extent yes, as behavior is learned. Regardless, we as individuals can take appropriate actions to avoid these risks without having the economy forcefully shut down until we all comply.

I think it’s strange how some (privileged) people are so opposed to the idea of opening up the economy again. There are people & businesses who are struggling financially because of this shutdown. Congress needs to get off of recess & pass more bills, or we have to open soon.

No, you dumb broad. When people go back to work we will get our economy back! Most people are NOT SICK!
Running the Country and planning to restart the economy requires the House to sit in some manner
No I see no flaw there people are practicing social distancing and the number still goes up and there’s still new cases see a flaw there it’s just all about control and tanking an economy doing better than ever so the rich can get richer
Sahil says it's dangerous when opening the economy is viewed as immoral, and easy for us to say when we are all working from home. Only a matter of time before blue collar workers and restaurant owners say enough is enough
You’re not a “shareholder” of this economy. Why? Because the economy can’t be broken down into individual ownership fragments the way a company can. The analogy is completely incongruous with anyone who actually KNOWS how investments work.
It’s unbelievable to me how stupid some people are...I just watched a video full of people that think # COVID19 isn’t real! Are you kidding me? Who would make this up? Who would shut down most of our countries economy for fun? Just because you don’t have the virus doesn’t mean

Maybe you should quit being mad at the government for taking the necessary steps to protect the vulnerable population of this country, and start getting mad that the capitalist, white supremacist patriarchy has conditioned you to care more about the "economy" than human lives...
We stomped the economy pretty good though, didn’t we? Got rid of that pesky thing.
It would not correct the economy. Hundreds of thousands of jobs would be lost immediately. There would have to be new jobs immediately available for those people to transition to....and not Obama type retail jobs.

I think 'consumers' will be preoccupied mourning their lost family members and friends, tempered by violent rage against brands and businesses seen to be supporting 'The Economy' over health and humanity.
Maybe do more research and what happens when the economy crashes. Either way people will die, atleast this way those who do pass will know their children still have home to live and a job to support them and their children to come.
It backfired on him, and we will probably have the worst economy in Europe and possibly the world.

Lol Kurt! Why are you so rude? I'll overlook your insults: Federal student loan portfolio = $1.515 Trillion https://studentaid.gov/data-center/student/portfolio … If Americans are to be competitive in a global economy, if we want a strong democracy, shouldn't we have educated people?
"BUT THE ECONOMY!" Dead people don't work. Dead people don't make shit. Dead people don't buy shit. An economy can be revived even from a Great Depression. But a pile of corpses is just a pile of corpses, so the question is - do you want to be one of them? Didn't think so.
Oh I expect the economy to be back and running quicker than that. I’m thinking about all the other damage that’s been done to the country, and rooting out corruption in the federal government.
The really troubling part is, I think people are not that clear on how the food gets to them, and I don't mean grocery clerks. If we don't plan to reopen some parts of the economy e.g. shipping, manufacturing, agriculture we won't have to worry about the virus
Trump wants Americans to think he inherited a bankrupt economy and national stockpiles that looked like the day after a frat party. Because OF COURSE that's how a black man would leave things, right?

To be fair ...the economy effects more than the disease. Which is why people are talking amongst themselves. I mean, we've already come this far, so might as well finish it out. But when lifted, there needs to be note discussions about preparedness.

I think this theory is bollocks. Only part of the country it *might* be true is London. Definitely an argument for taking different regional approaches, with London in stricter lockdown for longer than the rest of the country/ economy.
I recently chatted to a 8 digit egg-head calling himself Tom H who claimed to be a top economist trying to teach the elite a better understanding of the economy.
Further, there's the political economy aspect of this. If farming and food production is booming, if mining is booming, workers in the cities will inevitably be compelled to seek work where there is work. Incentivised either by hunger (broadly speaking) or inflation

Trudeau is finally getting the dictatorship he so admired. Think he’ll turn our economy around on a dime. (I hope you remember this reference)
The reason is simple: too much concentration of the global value chain ( # GVC) in one single location: # China. China's share in the global economy is some 15-17% but it exports 32% of the world's intermediate goods. It was efficient for companies but it turns out it was too risky

Your argument doesn’t make any sense. A failure to contain the virus will cost far more economically than containing the virus by limiting the economy for a short period. It is not necessary to kill people to contain the virus. Letting it run for “herd immunity” will not work
it’s literally saving lives are you serious? yeah the economy is going to shit, my parents are small business owners don’t try to bs me. but saying the economy is more important than HUMAN LIVES is the most disgusting white male thing of you to say

Private means not public. Small business is the engine room of an economy. Entrepreneurship will lift the world out of this, not governments and bloated public sector bureaucracies.

If the death rate is somewhat close to the flu (likely a 1% or 2% higher) then. Yes people should be able to go on with their lives. How long do you think social distancing should last because deaths also result from an awful economy.
Money. I mistakenly believed that moving to a capitalist economy would move the country to democracy. It just shifted to authoritarian fascism. China is clearly an enemy state that is preparing for economic and even a military war against the West. Time to stop helping them
Lmk when you guys are done talking about how the UI expansion is going to ruin our economy forever by incentivizing people to not work when we, if you recall, don’t want people at work, and didn’t give business any money to keep them getting paychecks!!

9/11 was also around during the impact of the dot com bust. So many companies went out of business. Some ideas were ahead of their time for sure....but nothing like the unemployment we are seeing the last month.
I’m no expert on numbers, but I don’t think someone should be making more on unemployment than they were being employed. And nurses generally aren’t paid what they’re worth. I believe that even more after being reassigned to a couple different nursing floors this week.

I thought it an extra $600 per month more per month in unemployment which also extended in weeks?
It seems the only thing that bothers him are poor numbers. Unemployment, polls, stock markets, etc. I’m guessing poll numbers are dropping.

Many major municipalities will not have enough money to pay their obligations. If they are forced to lay off police, fireman, etc. It will only increase unemployment, and worse not paying wages of necessary workers will create chaos in cities who are in a bind.

And yet, they say unemployment is rising cause hotels and other industries related to tourism were hard hit. Imagine countries with strict lockdowns.
All the money went to large corporations... split into “500 or less”done quickly and stealthy ... leaving no money for ANY little operator. Meanwhile, we keep our employees on who get stimulus checks, welfare and unemployment... it’s very sneaky. The system is full of HOLES!

So, a friend that was unemployed a few years ago and was granted unemployment, informed me that he believes what was received was 25% of his monthly wage, and it lasted a total of 3 months. Sooo, who or how is anyone making more than when they were employed!?! https://twitter.com/thehill/status/1251261905366212609 …
What is this incentive? You can’t get unemployment if you quit, so you’ve either been fired by a company trying to save themselves or you’re still working there. This is beyond stupid.
He also delivered: 38,000+ deaths 22 million+ unemployment claims + lies 0 confidence in our government
@ Fla_Pol Where does our Senator and Gov stand on calling out to Congress and US Treasury to stop letting creditors take stimulus checks? People are desperate and with the unemployment fiasco many need that stimulus. Floridians want an answer are you willing to get us that?

No celebrity or "person of means" should be allowed to voice their opinion on the halting of the economy. No celebrity or "POM" is waiting over a month for unemployment, or lost their insurance, or could lose their home or car. Shut up and stay in your mansion.

He needs to judge his way to the unemployment line!
Got immediately rejected from applying for Pennsylvania pandemic unemployment can I get an f in the chat
Possibly America also needs to reconsider its role as central banker to the world. The reality is that there is symmetrical cause and effect between the current account and the capital account. Unfriendly foreign capital can cause debt reduce demand and increase unemployment...
Fantastic move, Steve! Bring in the CEO of Stark Industries to fix the state’s screwed unemployment division. Maybe he can get Tony Stark(Ironman) to come in and run a couple extra phone lines or answer the phone!
The Wuhan Flu's toll, China's pandemic, when done, will likely include tens of thousands of unnecessary deaths, massive unemployment, trillions of dollars more in debt and trillions of dollars in lost wealth not to mention emotional hardship and educational disruption. # FixedIt
That compares their unemployment benefits to our stimulus check. Apples to oranges. Bernie got us $600/week UI plus state benefits and the stimulus check. People still need more help though, no doubt about that.
i understand that but there are much MUCH better ways to protest than jeopardizing the lives of hundreds. it is downright stupid and selfish. this will only last longer and gee, it lasting longer means more months of unemployment due to extension of quarantine bcos of that.
Trump has a problem if he runs on "I did everything to defeat the invisible enemy." Meanwhile, as of today 700000 confirmed cases and over 34000 deaths and climbing. He can't run on the economy, he's killed it. Or unemployment, is at 22m or 13%. He's done. https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/04/16/gallup-poll-trump-approval-slips-coronavirus-economic-crisis-continue/5147032002/ …

I respect your right to choose but I can't join the effort, sir. One point of contention I have with your argument was the unemployment numbers. It was, IN FACT, the Obama Administration that started the upward trend of those numbers.
I grew up in super poor white trash trailer parks all my life and not once did anyone in those days on unemployment or welfare or food stamps be out here ballin like they were rich in fact the only actually rich people was the drug dealers specifically meth dealers in my area.
@ GovNedLamont it’s time to talk opening the state. There is unemployment and economic collapse everywhere. I understand cautious but enough of this. Late May is simply too late to start to open the state.
@ Jamie-DiVanna. Self employed mom that doesn’t qualify for unemployment or SBA loan. Times are rough
It’s not about special interests. It’s about the survival of all small businesses and massive unemployment. It’s time to shelter the most at-risk, and let anyone who wants to get back to work!
Has anyone else noticed how Whitless said UIA payments would be extended until December but when you try to file it only says available until July 25th? I have never filed unemployment before so it isn't because I've used my time up? Hmm..
FYI they don’t have to stay home if they want to return to work essential workers are tired and can use the help. Go make their pay at mcdonalds Burger King amazon Uber farm hands daycare workers but the unemployment checks and bitching is easier.
Self-serve = unemployment. Think about it.
Also, people are having trouble getting unemployment insurance. Those checks may take months. It’s all B.S. People have to get back to work.
24 an hour doesn’t even make sense. Unemployment caps out in my state at least, and it’s not what I make at 40hrs. Nurses make more than me, and most work overtime as there’s few of them. Plus you can’t just “choose” to not work and get unemployment.
Lol. For weeks MSM conducting their Narrative of how to put on a mask and then I see this. No wonder the unemployment website is down.

They are the ones who will be making MORE money on unemployment and the added $600/wk. of course they won’t want to go back. And I was a single mom working 3 jobs, went to college at 28 and worked hard to get where I am. Capable people don’t need more handouts.
Check unemployment stats and the DOW. Its easy. Google is your friend.
Trade the risk not the news. Unemployment is temporary. Once there is good news it'll be too late to enter. More people are at home trading. News doesn't have a direct correlation. There are delays and sometimes it's irrelevant.

My money goes out as quickly as it comes in. I'm sitting on a pile of debt accumulated during 3 years of unemployment. My current job pays enough to maintain that debt, but not reduce it.

Great job Rob. Really. But how many people in your state have not received their unemployment? I’m one. It’s been almost 5 weeks.
GOOD NEWS! New unemployment claims dropped by 50,000 last week. Our leaders are winning and fighting for YOU the proletariat! Don't look at that 1,500,000 total. That means nothing to you and is the fault of our Bourgeoisie oppressors! Submit or be re-educated!

Well if you look at what any state utilizes its money on you would be floored. It is like Florida backing WWE as being essential but not paying unemployment to its people. I am for Trump for re-election but the issue is that people really should take the virus into consideration.

Why would anybody that's getting enhanced unemployment want to go back to work during a pandemic, when they are getting most of the pay. The tDump campaign is paying these people to go out and stir the pot.1 in 5 have have or had Covid 19, that 68 MILLION people in the US.
The mere fact that healthcare coverage is tied to and subsidized by employment is reason enough to prefer employment to unemployment. Americans aren’t lazy.
So your prediction is for 10 of millions of deaths. You do know that for every point of unemployment there are 10K suicides and countless families destroyed. We are talking about doing this in a responsible fashion. No one is forced to act prematurely.

The good things about the economy under Trump are only good BECAUSE of Obama. Take unemployment for example. Under Obama it went from 11.4% down to 4.6%, a monumental feat. With Trump, job growth has slowed, and it went down a little over a point, yet Trump still takes credit.
Food for Thought, How much of a % of the lock down is prevent the spread of the virus and How much of a % of it is a hope to use it to harm Trump's reelection in nov so they can claim largest unemployment spike in history or something along those lines?

When will that be? What is “adequate”? You can’t be this vague when 10 million people are going on unemployment a week. Some states have less than 20 deaths, why should they be “locked down?” Most counties in this country still have more flu deaths than covid-19 deaths ffs

No, a party that profits off its people (votes) but doesn't do anything for them (high crime, unemployment, failing schools) that is a plantation to me. The true plantation owners in the south were Democrats.
Massachusetts already completely barred me from receiving any unemployment assistance related to a job I lost years ago because I answered honestly that I was sick for 2 weeks. Really, that cascaded for years and was a significant factor leading to the situation I'm in now.
Small biz self owned biz do get unemployment
Yes, I know I have zero income coming and have been laid off over a month and half now. Unemployment might show up might not have 5 weeks claimed and all still say not processed. My stress level seems to increase as my rent approaches really quick. Have gto stay hopeful.
We pay into unemployment insurance here and can collect when we lose our job. During the lockdowns our government has appropriated more money for this.

Wanting the economy to do better and close the wage gap are not mutually exclusive. Having the unemployment rate sky rocket IS worse than the virus spreading.
Do you even understand the talking points you are parroting? Wages have been stagnant for 20 years so working/mid class need husband, wives, and multiple jobs to stay afloat. Unemployment is not the measure to determine success. Try again.
Yeah unemployment benefits are helpful, but unfortunately dont account for a lot situations. For example, the lady who does my wife's hair is self employed and doent qualify for unemployment. She also doesnt qualify for sba loan bc she doesn't have any employees. # TextUBIto50409
This is where luck kicked in for millions of people in the U.S. A lot of people are getting 600/week and 2/3 of their salary (typical unemployment). That’s 2700/month + unemployment wages.
already right now ppl are making much more on unemployment. some people are also making less. all projections are to fit the median & mode of citizens! it’s the way the cookie crumbles with socialism!! (which i agree is necessary in a pandemic aside from typically sucking)

“...While previous pandemics cut the labour force, this crisis will increase unemployment, perhaps to levels unknown for centuries, and bosses will exploit workers’ desperation so that they can keep wages low and conditions poor.”
As a small business owner, I'm concerned about the employees who can't even file for unemployment because the systems are overloaded. Everyone need our concern.

On the restaurant chain question, are employees going to be eligible to continue to collect enhanced unemployment benefits if they refuse to come back to work when the restaurants reopen? We are seeing signs that this may be an issue in some states.
Supposedly they extended traditional unemployment so I don't know if I should just log in and start claiming weeks again but due to intervening self-employment income don't want to be permanently banned.

Here is the kicker. The official state unemployment rate is 4.3%. Why? The UE system is backlogged so badly that they have not yet been calculated in the State's Unemployment rate. I left there two years ago but I have so many friends there as I lived there for 44 years.

No stimulus, no unemployment, no nothing.....Florida get your act together @ GovRonDeSantis
You’re disgusting. It it wasn’t for the decisions of the president the toll would be even higher. Thank the useless democrats for the massive unemployment sitting in their mansions on paid vacation while our president toils away every day. Stop your lies.
If they have lost their jobs _ there is unemployment for 6 months, and public aid just to keep a leg up. I am there right now myself...not happy about it myself, but am doing what I have to do to stay healthy. Don’t go running to Walmart every day just to have an outing...
Ughhhh I need my next unemployment check to get here I'm out of shampoo and conditioner
As national unemployment figures continue to rise, it’s worth keeping an eye on the Keystone State. Pennsylvania is a state that closely tracks national averages, and it offers a snapshot of the United States as a whole. http://cityjourn.al/2RBG2NF via @ nicolegelinas
A "deep state rat" who saw 75 straight months of job growth with almost 16 million jobs created after the recession, unemployment decline by more than half from a high of 10% to 4.7%, and the Dow Jones increase by 148%.
However, this is a way to alleviate the unemployment process as well. Its a positive if used correctly.
Thinking of you & wishing you the best. I don't know how it works in your state but it's at least two weeks in ours to get unemployment. Also, stimulus checks have started to go out. https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2020/04/18/not-got-your-1200-stimulus-check-keep-calm-and-trust-google/ …
What is of profound interest to me is that no @ TheDemocrats dispute that our economy, best it's ever been, unemployment, lowest it's ever been, but they cannot and will not ever admit that it's because of our President, @ realDonaldTrump and how he's made America great again!!!
Take a look at your wonderful track record pal! The stock market has crashed! We’ve got a plague that’s totally out of control! Unemployment rates that are higher than ever! A country so divided it’s pathetic! Joe couldn’t possibly be any worse beside Obama said he’s good

20% unemployment rate will kill more people than the virus.
1. The unemployment rate should hit close to 20% and the GDP should drop about 6 points. That’s a great Economy?
Well at lest there weren’t 25k dead in a bungled pandemic (so far) and 30% unemployment.
Trump back to basics with bigotry as there is record high unemployment and economy being what it is with the COVID situation.
Same on mine. No idea why. I filed last year and owed... but I can’t get past that part to put in my direct deposit info. Also, I’m entering week six and zero unemployment.

Poor old woman, ordered by GOP governor to shut her business, hasn't seen a penny from stimulus, unemployment or EIDL SBA loans...tells you to shut up. If I can't pay bills, you "bored" people can suck it up.
This is the Democrat's dream! Unemployment!!! Unfortunately, people will vote for these socialists!
Rofl during a time of utmost uncertainty and record unemployment and looming potential recession. Terrible advice all things considered.
Evictions are not allowed for 3 months. You can apply for unemployment and that extra $1,200 check. Charge groceries and essential items. If you have loan payments, call the company and work out a deal. Call your utilities, phone, internet, TV, and any other monthly bills, too

Neeley. We retail employees have to go mingle with the public daily for smaller wages. Can't refuse to work because then we aren't able to get unemployment, although I still haven't heard back about my status on that in 3 weeks.

@ realDonaldTrump one thing you don't understand I told you everything you've lied about about the last Administration is going to happen to you unemployment will be like 40 45% not like the 5% did you inherit it the stock market is going to go blow when you took over everything
Trying to get my brother to answer his phone is more complicated than getting the unemployment office to answer the phone during this mess.
They will file regardless but LLC etc takes time and professional CPA with no one working..So based of 2018 misses changed situation in 2019. Allow proof of income even under an LLC to be uploaded keeping in mind gig workers, 1099, Rideshare are not helped by unemployment either.
Unemployment is complete shit
Like it or not it was the quickest way to keep a significant number of people off unemployment. The state unemployment offices are already overwhelmed. Of the businesses that rcv’d the ppp loan, imagine if they didn’t and had to layoff every employee instead.
also fun update is that because i have only one W2 job, i get a whopping..... $69 (nice!) in unemployment per week. and because i applied for that already, i am now ineligible for the unemployment for independent contractors. yeah. gotta love the sweet, horrific irony.
Looks like my unemployment got cancelled on time, despite the pandemic. The United States Of America continues to be a perpetual disappointment! Thanks for absolutely fucking nothing, you stupid plot of land.
It you have recived the 1200 in stimulus and 1200 from unemployment, hopefully 2400 can help to feed you and pay bills. And I know this from experience.

Priti Patel always said the points system had to be flexible. However, as unemployment will rise post-virus I would expect more UK workers to go into care as it’s going to be viewed differently and the pay must rise.
You do know of course that Obama brought unemployment from 10% to 4.7%. (-5.3%) and trump just continued that down from 4.7% to 3.6% (-1.1%) right? Not much of an achievement. Sort of letting Obama run 25 miles of a marathon, then run the last 1.2 miles and claim victory.

To the unemployment line
How about you all cut your salaries to the unemployment insurance level and it stays their until the economy recovers. Guess you would have a different view about needing to wait until we are absolutely sure.
1) if you’re at home on lockdown and unable to work then you collect unemployment. Which is enough. 2) if you work overtime or not you are still compensated for work. You aren’t making sense here. Bottom line: your probably upset you have to pay property tax for schools too.
The inability of NY to process unemployment insurance. Everyone waiting weeks and weeks
Every 1% of unemployment has some very serious ramifications

Need insurance after unemployment lest some dumbstick misunderstands
That's a really crushing procedure, I'm sorry trying to get onto unemployment has been so hard
Because it's new and would require adjusting thinking for how it works with minimum wage and unemployment insurance.
Not all of us can live on unemployment we have businesses that involve payments and insurance we have to be working so you Dems need to remember we don't make millions when we aren't working or even when we are we have to much government involved we will start working
I see some people saying 'once the unemployment payments kick in, it'll be fine'. I'm not so sure.
Flood the unemployment market, force the government to rely on welfare, and dilute the dollar by forcing more printing, thus making the Chinese yuan more valuable than the dollar. And can anyone guess who secretly benefits from having their own ties to China?

That works if you have a guaranteed income like you. How about you all cut your salary to the unemployment insurance level not to be restored until the economy is recovered? Guessing you will have a reason why that doesn’t work!
People are so wrapped up in this virus stuff, unemployment , loss of business, food shortages etc they can't think about much more. It's too early yet. Sadly not enough darkness has hit showing methods we have experienced. It will come.

Slow the hec down... you’re going to get us all killed before we’ve even seen a dime of stimulus funds or unemployment.

Everyone in pays the same rate of Federal taxes. If your income is higher, you pay more tax. During boom years Albertan’s income was higher - so they paid more tax to the Feds. What’s the problem? With high unemployment now, the total Fed taxes collected from AB will be lower.
They've done it before. This time might be different but currently the stock market goes up every time 5 million people apply for unemployment. This time might be different.

I agree with you. Without socialist aspects of our system, we fail (like you said, right now). Never was a huge fan of Mnuchin, and definitely not after that comment. One could argue if everyone was able to get unemployment benefits, then a quick 1200 helps UNTIL that kicks in

If people would get more on unemployment than at their job, they are being paid starvation wages. Sounds like some employers need to quit treating their employees like indentured servants and pay a living wage.
Congress, President Trump, all of the Supreme Court Justices along with the Secretary of The Treasury and all of the Fed Presidents are in deep discussions to suspend gravity until unemployment returns to pre-virus levels through a new special purpose funding vehicle. # Bitcoin
Let’s say you’re a small business owner, in NY you’ve been closed since 3/16. Your taxes show you’re finally bringing in more than 75,000 (tons of expenses), so you don’t qualify for stimulus relief. Likely can’t qualify for unemployment. The SBA is dry. You’ve received 0 help.

If I was a person that lost my job I would be freaking out. What will happen to retail and restaurant workers? Those jobs are not coming back anytime soon. $1200 is no where near enough. Unemployment if you can wade through the paperwork will help but it is less than needed.

That's true, but keep in mind that some of these protesters are protesting out of desperation. Small business are facing the possibility of permanently shutting down. Workers aren't getting their paychecks. The only solution to this that they can see is reopening the economy.
Amazing how the government forcibly shutting down most of the business activity in a country "collapsed" the economic system. The morally wrong notion in this country is the cancerous idea that the government is supposed to always expand and replace personal responsibility.
For # COVIDiots who think that # Coronavirus is just a “hoax” to hurt # Trump, why are 185 nations curtailing tourism, closing borders, building hospitals, shutting schools, halting shipping, suspending business operations, limiting personal freedoms, and tanking their economies? pic.twitter.com/ZGnjXim8P5

I have a small retirement business I didn’t shut down and I have intentions of shutting down.
Also, the health department analogy is this: determining if a business is putting public health at risk and shutting them down if so.

My point, though, is that no one is willing to mention specifics. What small businesses want to open, but can't? Bars? Hobby stores? The truth is that lots of businesses were shutting down before the order and lots of business leaders don't want to reopen until it's safe.

Any company that has 500 employees is not a small business. How much of that money went to companies of that size? Our favorite diner with 10 employees didn’t get a cent. Close to shutting down. That will be a shame.

Lost 2 businesses, most of my retirement, and a VP of Sales job in the Bush depression. Learned that "out on a limb" without 6 months of capital reserve is a sure recipe for bankruptcy (didn't file). If shutting down for 6 months kills your business, you were doomed anyway.

Wait there's less carbon emissions around the world due to countries shutting down and yet its still increasing.... hmm its almost like there's little effect we can take to change it.
No, the case I'm making is that Newsom was right to ignore business interests, who wanted him to wait, and listen to health experts. He understood the importance of urgency in shutting down. Days mattered in mid March.

Sam Harris has a great podcast out talking about the problem with this argument. You’re comparing it to what the economy *was* a few months ago. Even if we did nothing the economy would start shutting down as the infections spread. It would not have been business as usual

My niece has a small business making vegan cheese. They've never been busier, despite their restaurant customers shutting down. They sell online.

California without question did the right thing shutting things down. Just as certain, people who lost their jobs and businesses that have been shut down are suffering. We could have done a much much better job delivering unemployment insurance and aid to small business.
The small business loans went to (very) big business, so the usual suspects have come out to blame democrats for shutting down small business. Kinda brilliant, actually.
Does deBlasio think we are stupid! Does he think by shutting down business this will be blamed on @ Potus?
Thank your partner in crime, yeah the one had to follow Ca's declaration WITHOUT thinking about any consequences, the short sighted governor Wolf. ANY real business person could have predicted shutting down the state's business would cause more problems than help best the flu!!
And they would have had another month or so of business (at most) before they shuttered due to how it hit the EU and the USA. Their reliance on China - as dumb as it is - isn't really a factor here. The worldwide box office is shutting down.
How do you square forcefully shutting down small businesses and not giving business owners enough money? The stimulus for businesses ran out. Now Congress is too busy on their Corona Virus vacation to vote on a clean bill. Trying to stuff it with progressive pork. Snakes.

Joe, it would appear to me that you have a legitimate suit against your government for shutting down your practice. The government is talking out of both sides of it’s mouth to justify their closing of your business.

One of my big questions about “opening up the economy”: Your business has an employee that tests positive, what are you doing? Nothing? Shutting it down again? Telling people and employee had it? Feels like a question few businesses that want to reopen have an answer for.
Agreed. They need to be focusing on how larger businesses like @ RuthsChris was able to get $20Million as a small business while many Mom and Pop businesses are shutting down in their own damn state. Oh.... Is it because our donations aren't big enough and we don't matter?
States like SD and Iowa don't really care about the employees in their "business friendly environments" bc most of these people are poor, POC or immigrants. If it was all white middle-class people who were sick and dying you'd be damn well sure they would be shutting shit down.

I disagree. Shutting down local non-essential business was a detriment in a widely tourism-driven state. If we lift the lockdown early we can expect an influx of tourists from states that didn't incur a lockdown and have to begin this process all over again.

He has done well. If doing well is simply growing debt spending and badgering the FED to monetize it. It's not really that hard since Congress approves every debt ceiling increase as they must since cutting government spending means cutting GDP.

You read my mind so you worked out the % Any business with a debt burden so many times it's turnover is permanently bankrupt. Profit for a private business obviously is much less than turnover, & in the case of a country's budget or GDP there is no profit, it runs on break even
He says we don't need to increase GDP, we could survive fine without producing more, so you bring up a lot of people who died in the past, draw a comparison between them. You're saying that the death your family experienced is relevant.

For what, listening to Trump talk about himself and bad mouth the Democratic Governors. NY State and California pay most of the bills in this Country. Between the two the GDP is 1/4 of the entire USA. Republican states are mostly takers, paying next to nothing in GDP.

Also the affordability to lock down is thee as demand is much more resilient and less momentum driven unlike US. More importantly, the higher nominal GDP - inflation will allow the cost to be filled in long run compared to places where the curve is negative.
Massive printing of money devalues cuurency. Fed buying Gov bonds increases Gov debt, pensions, Medicare, and trade debt already all time high. Debt is payed off with GDP growth. Low unemployment = low GDP. Only solution to pay back debt is devalue currency amidst inflation.

Oil/gas and the energy sector in general has never represented more than 8% of Canadian GDP, has never been the top sector and has received massive government subsidies. Oil money did not build, or sustain, this country
The 2.8 is oil, the 8 is oil AND gas. Mainly exports, like manufacturing industry, why not shift the 2.8 there? It adds more to GDP than the O+G industry, is not being phased out like FF use, and doesn't start from behind like our harder to access and process tar sands.

Back on track? You mean open borders, free tuition for all, crappy health care, Socialism, 2nd Amendment attacked, low GDP, kissing up to foreign countries, closing factories, no more energy independence-- yea those good ole days.

Pew found that for every 1% increase in GDP, the death rate for men 70 to 74 years of age increased by about a third of a percentage point (0.36%). The increase was just as large for men 40 to 44 years old (0.38%). https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/10/16/a-downside-to-an-up-economy-mortality-rates-increase-in-better-times/ …
Maine received twice the payroll % then California did. Maine’s contribution to the GDP is minuscule compared to California’s. How does this make sense? Oh that’s right, politician’s who support rapist’s for the Supreme Court get more....
Mixture of indicators? Carbon intensity of GDP i.e. CO2/GDP and then the elasticity of GDP vs CO2, always positive so far. I think correlation of intensity vs GDP growth can be negative due to ballooning GDP or in the case of Mexico, exploding trade to GDP ratio. e.g. w eora #pic.twitter.com/kMOsvPhOiS
SNB: 120% of GDP!
@ Google shows old data for Pakistan when you search GDP per capita. When you do it for India, it shows the prediction at the top. Also, if you search median income for Pakistan, it again shows old records. There is definitely something wrong.
Not clear to me that the return on investment growing faster than GDP contradicts Marx's falling rate of profit
Funny how trump never achieved a GDP Obama did
it isn't silly or unmerited. Healthcare is a huge percentage of our GDP, a tiny percentage of this stimulus. Even if it wasn't, running HHS is not oversight experience. There are endless other candidates for this position.
The electoral map shows Democrats control all the major wealth cities in America. Hillary boasted that the counties she won make up 2/3 of the countries wealth / GDP. Republicans 1/3. Democrats own Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, NBC, ABC, CBS, Disney, Hollywood, All Banking. Etc
List of countries with gdp per capita ppp no less than the US (World Bank): 1. Arab oil kingdom 2. Tax haven with abnormally high cross-border commutes 3. Singapore 4. Leprechaun 5. South-east Asian oil kingdom
See...I told you @ fabio ....They never know what the freedom of speech is.... this kind of Chinese from CCP only knew about money! And they thought they are rich even though the personal income GDP in China is so low compare to other country.....
This being meant how can we achieve GDP 9% ? Unsubstantiated!
HHS has everything to do with the stimulus. Do you have any idea what health care costs are a percentage of our GDP? Hospital budgets and shattered, mass layoffs and wages and salaries have been slashed. Your criticism of the appointment is silly and unmerited.
Also, considering our relative poverty rate, we have the lowest social spending rate of these counties: 16.2% of GDP. Social spending is necessary to ensure the health, safety & well-being of our citizens. Because of our low social spending, it makes sense why so many people
1/3: I know a $2 trillion stimulus package is incomprehensible and scary big, but let’s put it in perspective. American GDP is about $21 trillion a year. Which currently puts us at about 1:1 debt to annual revenue ratio. Now, I don’t like it as much as the next guy, BUT...

This is the same no deal planning that: • cost us £200Bn+ in below trend GDP growth before Covid • prevented us from joining the EU scheme to bulk-buy PPE • reduced cooperation on Covid vaccine research • deprived us of 80K EU fresh food pickers > reduced supplies & î prices

Somehow I feel like they shouldn't be able to contribute to GDP! Lol
That’s a fair point. There is evidence thought to support the fact that if you contract an economy and GDP is sent tumbling then lives will be lost. The most vulnerable sections of society. A contraction like we are seeing will be devastating. Everyone must see that.

It’s our ppl (SAn) who choose to follow those churches.some foreigners r running businesses thus increasing our GDP. It’s just unfortunate that most SAn don’t have capital/education to start businesses o get proper employment so we argue that foreigners are taking “our” jobs.
You're the only one here that lied about O&G's impact on Canada's GDP.
That is the definition of social inequity. And the cherry is Xi at the top — directing huge margin of state piggy bank towards infrastructure contracts adding to party coffers for his billions. Meanwhile CN spends mere 2% GDP on health That’s lower than Mexico’s spend.
There is no standard definition of Depression, but given that the GDP prints in Q2 & Q3 will both be 20+% below the Q1 figure, even if Q3 shows improvement, this will dwarf the 2008-2009 downturn. The length will be determined by COVID breakthroughs or lack thereof. Buckle up.
Several studies and exercises have been done, Andrew, as you know. Tory govts since 2010 swept them under the carpet and spent the least amount, as a % of GDP, on the NHS of any govt since its founding. Privatisation has also accelerated and sucked money out.
Yet US NIIP is record -50% of GDP.

This is a straight up lie. O&G accounts for 2-4% of our GDP depending on the year.
Thabo Mbheki said no to IMF and World Bank post 1994. Even though we were bankrupt. His reason was it would give them power to tell us how to run SA. He turned thing around.

Tell me about the amazing safety net of the USA. And the FED does not provide any added value in terms of GDP growth, but is merely used as 'lender of last resort', buying bonds like crazy and this has a large inflating effect on the stock market..
151,278 - that’s the number of homeless in the entire state of CA. 40mil people live in CA. That is 0.37% of our population. Also, CA 2019 GDP is $3.17tril — if sovereign, CA would be the 5th largest economy in the WORLD.
What facts am I missing on TMX? The auto bailouts are one of the reasons I generally oppose those kind of govt interventions. Cost billions and we lost a good % of jobs. While auto is smaller than O&G it supports way more direct jobs proportionally (per gdp $ a multiple more).
Drastic unemployment Corporate bankruptcies Fed abuse State bailouts GDP contraction Tech bubble 2.0 Pension time bombs Congress overspending Consumer disappearance Explosion of debt Even if you pick just two of these, it warrants the worst global recession of our lifetime.
Correct. Counting the excess death mortality for 2020 (and 2021) will most likely be how how the end "result" will be measured for all countries. And then the tricky part comes when you have to compare it to the drop in GDP.
I hope something like # DonutEconomics by @ KateRaworth that accounts for environment and society without # GDP as success measure.
Recessions — traditionally defined as two consecutive quarters of GDP contraction — are fairly regular occurrences, with 11 taking place between 1945 and 2009, with an average of roughly 11 months between peak and trough.

Yeah cheap foreign labor for big multinational corporations is worth depressing wages, straining welfare, overwhelming housing, changing demographics, increased crime and poverty, lower social trust, etc. Keep seeing it through the lense of the altar of GDP.
Well it kinda is...GDP way down...consumer spending 2/3 of GDP! Employment way up! Same but different!
The problem with a sales tax is that it’s far to easy to increase. Restrict by constitutional amendment the % of GDP that the Federal government can take in.
It's the lowest in almost any advanced nation on Earth. Every nation with a higher standard of living and greater social mobility than us spends a far higher percentage of their GDP on services than we do.

It’s not exactly mind blowing to understand that large economies with international currencies like the Yen and USD can get away with more debt/GDP, but that doesn’t mean anyone on earth knows where the limit will be, because everything else doesn’t stay equal.
Lol CA leaving the US would be disastrous for the rest of the country. If they were a country right now they’d have the third highest GDP in the world.

As long as we live in a world where virtually all “money” is “loaned” into exsistence by the “private sector” instead of “spent” into existence by the government, the DEBT to GDP ratio will be over 100% with all wealth going to the financial sector & none to the public good...

That's why I support the devouring of the rich and redistribution of their wealth. Hear me out. Instead of losing 9 million we lose 1/3000th of that, and the GDP would grow by 50% giving a huge jumpstart to the economy. Only reason I can think for no, is people die. XD

What they are missing: People can reopen but upwards of 70% of us will stay home. No planes, hotels, restaurants, shopping or movies for a long while. So it is pointless. Plus, if the coasts don’t consume; 1/3 of our gdp is locked down. They are idiots. Don’t give them air.
