We are going to Trump LANDSLIDE 2020...we will be playing baseball in a few weeks, and our Economy will be on its way up to DOW30K!! Some states are open, but it's Almost time to Reopen the rest of the USA for Business!! The USA will defeat this plague!! # MAGA # BestPresident

Correct! Smart move, and no that was not racist in my eyes. Those who said it was are idiots including Democrats. He took a decisive action but for what ever reason decided not to do anything when it arrived to the homeland. You know why? Cares more about the Economy, not lives.
One can provide security for Arkansans and still keep our economy healthy (Considering).
I agree. Have you been listing to Tucker Carlson and he is saying the same thing. One size does not fit all. China must be loving this. They do not mind loosing a million Chinese to America's 50k if they can shut our economy down and damage America. You could see this coming.
The economy with this idiot will never recover neither my mind ....Jesus what a Joke
He stopped the economy to save lives so STFU.
7) Shutting down the economy, putting 10 MILLION Americans out of work in 2 weeks, and TRILLIONS in Recovery Bills would be totally unnecessary if ALL Americans were prescribed # hydroxycholorquine and # zpak than this epic fail. @ realDonaldTrump
Because the UK made the wrong decisions a decade ago. The USA chose to invest, like it is doing now and like the UK government is going as well. And the more money flows into the economy - and into Merseyside - the better
Charles please expand on this. ALL of Canada suffers at this rate, but it does point out a fallacy of relying on one product whose price you have no control over to feed your economy. I am disappointed in all Alberta Premiers of the past who have not made a dent in this manifesto

@ paulkrugman My naive concern for our economy is the ripple effect of missed rents & mortgages on individuals and businesses. What if we froze all of that - no one pays for 6 months. Who takes the hit? How big would the hit be? Doesn’t that have more impact than $1200?

People just need to be smart about it. But get back to work or keep working. I don’t agree with destroying the biggest economy in the world in a matter of months. For V2 of swine flu. We got over that. Well get over this.
Plus, we have over 100 trillion in unfunded liabilities coming up that isn't gonna end well. Our currency & entire economy could collapse if we don't address the debt, Social Security & Medicare.
Yeah, this is one case where I know more than others. A lot of the modeling still supports a worse case, but people at lower levels are doubting the modeling done by higher. It is an interesting situation right now. continue to stop the spread by destroying the economy?
He WILL open your country too soon, he’s desperate to get the economy moving, he doesn’t care about anything or anyone else.
I know. I addressed the complexities of the world to you before. The economy being good kind of loses it’s luster when are parents and grandparents are wiped out. Again, it would have been millions dead if not for stay at home. Instead it will “only be” hundreds of thousands
Yes, and many of them are the ones that will lead local efforts to restart the economy.
Y'all really believe Trump can win the election without the Bernie Bros swinging the vote he can't especially with a hundred to two hundred thousand people dying in the next two to three months with the economy shot to shit he has no chance unless the bros come through for him

No, it is a bit more logical than that. He needs the economy to restart so that the stock market recovers in time for November. There is only one crisis for him: his re-election. Come September, and this virus is still ravaging the country, "what does he have to lose"?

Yep, China become the 2nd largest economy in the world by faking all their numbers! Nice smooth brain take
I am sorry that people are sick with not only the Corona Virus, but the Flu, Cancer, Heart Decease and so on, but to collapse the best economy in the world is as ridiculous as it gets & I've grown to absolutely hate the FAKE MEDIA as well as the CORRUPT DEMOCRAT ELITE!
Sadly, what Small Businesses will have to try to recover from is an economy completely destroyed by Government Officials reacting to “models” that are as accurate as the Democratic 2016 Polls were. ER’s are empty, nurses hours are being cut. It’s time to end the fear propaganda.
Fauci is full of shit!A “little man” that wants the power to dictate the powers over us and the economy!
I’ve been reading McCullough’s Truman and learned how difficult it was to bring the economy and society ‘back’ from the Depression + WWII. It wasn’t easy - even with good and clear leadership.
The situation in Sweden will be interesting to see. They are doing a lot less of the social isolation and business shut downs. They may have more socialist programs but they realize that it is the economy that fuels those programs.
Happy to do this every IF they open the economy
IMO his base is done with having to constantly defend him. Plus the economy was bound to tank when his policies started catching up with him.

Right now just about anything would be better than what we have in the United States. We have a central bank and a financial system that is literally looting the economy. Only God know what they want all that money for, but I am sure it is for some nefarious reason.
If the economy collapses when people buy only what they need, maybe it is time to rethink our concept of economy.
Economic Health happens when there is Worker Health. Workers and Small Businesses are the backbone of our Economy, not Mega-Monolith companies from the top down
A major source of objection to a free economy is precisely that it ... gives people what they want instead of what a particular group thinks they ought to want. Underlying most arguments against the free market is a lack of belief in freedom itself. - Milton Friedman

So your point is the economy is more important than human life? Guess who keep the economy going, people. Guess what happens when everyone stays at home because of fear of dying from a disease, the economy stops.
You are responsible for never replenishing the PPE used for the H1N1 virus and you didn't care that 60 million infected and 12 thousand Americans died. You never closed the country down because you didn't want to hurt the economy. Just proves how little you actually care.
You on the left deal in unsubstantiated allegations based on your prejudice. We on the right deal in facts. Fact: He created the most prosperous economy in our history by deregulating Obama’s stifling regulations like banning oil exploration everywhere.

Lives, and the economy directly relates to lives. You remember 2008-2011 I would assume? I lived near highway 100 and Capital, would hear gunshots every 5 minutes. Sometimes just a shot, sometimes a shootout. A lot of people died for various reasons, directly due to the economy.
Bullshit. The economy would crash otherwise you fool. I mean worse than the depression
. @ realDonaldTrump They say Trump downplayed it. Personally, the last thing I would want to see is the leader of the country up there panicking like a bitch. And yes we do need to think about the economy. Once this is over and we have mourned the dead, life will go on.
The economy he got from Obama? That he managed the slow the growth of?
trump is loosing tons of money, he’s desperate to open the economy, so why doesn’t he declare a national quarantine, instead 8 states have people wandering around, going to church?All this will slow the viral recovery and slow the economy.
He needs to worry about the economy and let the doctors in charge make those decisions, I am not a Trump hater at all! But, he really needs to shut up on this matter, starting to piss me off! It shows it is not a miracle drug and does very little if in late stages.

How does an economy raise prices by that exact amount? What it does is reduces income inequality and raised the floor much higher. It’s similar to raising minimum wage but better because it helps more people and doesn’t lower employment opportunities

Great answer so what improved the US’s economy, businesses, innovations etc or just the government?
Not if you are the Democrats & the leftist media. They want deaths to rise & the economy to fall. They feel it’s the only way to defeat Trump. News: Morjing will defeat Trump - and certainly not feeble doddering old Joe
Seems like the argument is that old people are happy to die to reduce the impact on the economy, or that their lives aren't really that important. Might want to ask a few more people affected other than his own father.

If you'd like to continue to damage the economy by spreading the virus, then by all means, go. The longer people gather in groups, the longer we'll be doing these shelter in place measures. Want a functional economy sooner? THEN DONT GO.

Thinking sports or our economy cannot get back until not a single person is impacted, you might as say this is the end. Your phrase “hogwash”. You & USA Today narrative goes back years. Another opportunity to bash Trump. How about bashing China. Blame ? Why can’t you say it.

Insane. Punish the poor. Just the density that they don’t get how this will hurt the economy they care about so much about is Mind boggling.
My husband asked me this morning for a paper bag for his as well. I’m sure a visit to the front lines can be arranged for cadet bone spurs. A garbage bag & a week old N95 I’m sure can be arranged. If they’re willing to die for the economy a signed DNR is all that’s needed.

Covid-19 reveals a dis-United States: many of its 50 states compete for the same protective resources, 7 Trump-allied governors say no to social/health restrictions, & Trump declines to wear recommended mask. Yet Corona ravages US population & economy. Not a good look for the US
Now that doesn’t make sense. The goal has to be to scare the hell out everyone and crash our economy just to score a win in Nov...Politicizing this virus is just wrong!

If we can't mitigate and control the results of a deadly virus, the economy won't matter. People want to work but if we all go back to life as normal, thousands more will die, our healthcare system.will be in shambles and this virus will continue to take a huge economic toll.

Fair. But maybe that's why when the S&P was 20x eps you should have been much less than fully invested... The shutdown of the economy was the catalyst. The disease started sometimes after the FED never raised sometime between 666 and all time highs.
So, when Obama claimed credit for the economy under President Trump you were there to point out the folly in that assertion, right? "Broad economic trends" and all...
So no, I am not a Trot. Nor can I ever be confused with one... I don't think Vanguardism is the way, and I do not think Marxist analysis of the economy or the society is correct, because it is based on a number of flawed assumptions, like man is primarily an economic actor.
Since, most of the COVID19 cases are in Luzon. VisMin doesn't need to suffer from lockdown. We just need to limit the ships/air flows. Just think of the Philippine economy, we are still a developing country. Just my two cents.

It's all for the pandemic. A big question remains. It is whether and how the rent is or is not paid back. At a minimum it keeps people in their apartments and if Trump opens the economy fast the hurt may be short. Hes really into opening us up, and my guess is it will be April 30

Yes, but unlike a novel, the economies we have, is what we live by at present, for real. Tell someone made unemployed or destitute, that their situation is a "artificial construct" I'm sure that'll be most comforting. No economy we construct would be undamaged by a lockdown.
# TrumpPressBriefing for all you Trump Supporters this is the reason we wanted his unqualified ass out of office The presidency is more than a great economy All the excuses you all use to explain away his incompetence has put our lives in danger and Please don’t bring up Obama
Also, in a global economy to think you stop viral spread by simply stopping flights in 1 direction from 1 country is naive to the extreme. Like locking the front door but leaving all other doors & windows open. It was a political stunt further evidenced by no additional planning.
You say that like they are mutually exclusive. Like it's all or nothing. There is a HUGE middle ground that does not ruin the entire economy and millions of people's lives. And I don't call 191 deaths in my state since JANUARY horrific. 191 deaths vs millions of ppl destitute
The problem is much of the economy is frozen, but not all of it. Banks, credit cards, utilities are still demanding payments when many many people have lost their incomes. There should be a 3 months skip for all bills.
You spent the first two months trying to humiliate Iran and China with their injuries and forgot your duty to America. You will not go without God's punishmen I am not sad for you, but I am sad for America which caused you to kill her and kill her economy and you still arrogant

Doing the right thing for America is NOT the same thing as doing the right thing for trump. In fact, they are polar opposites. Dr Fauci is a doctor. He will do right by his patients, the people of the US. The economy is trump's to f**k up. And he will.

On the other hand, China has already control the virus and start to let people go back to work. Hope you will not lose your job after this disease, because you know, every time after US's economy corruption, most of the western world will suffer.
People all you have to do is humble yourselves and sit still for a minute. (The plagues of Egypt). Worship athletes, shut down stadiums. Worship musicians, shut down Civic Centers. Worship actors shut down theaters. Worship money, shut down the economy/stock market. Etc.
That's why I asked, I do have well to do conservative friends, I hear how they talk. Mostly as long as the economy is doing good for their pocket book, they couldn't care less about "other" issues. Like farmers going bankrupt & big agri buying them out.
So Bill Gates is willing to lose 3 billion on his project to speed up the process of creating a vaccine for this virus because it will save lives and potentially help the economy recover quicker. Do you think Bill Gates hates money?

Gotta keep that economy going at the expense of the people.
I don’t see how that’s possible now if ever was in the wake of a global recession and pandemic. I do not want a demented, segregationist rapist advocating for more neoliberal economic policies in the wake of an economy that no longer exists. It doesn’t make any sense.

Before you can reopen the economy the question you need to ask is what metric are you going to use.
Whenever an economy collapses, suicides spike. People need to feel a sense of purpose, and depending upon the government to pay their bills because they've been fired is at odds with that. We've had 10 million file for unemployment in 2 weeks. Your authoritarianism kills.
Exactly. The economy won’t bounce back right away when this is over...wonder if illegal crossings will?
We are not wanted going out.... for some reason that I'm sure we will discover in years to come. As of now we do as we're told, without question, regardless of the damage we are doing to our families, children, businesses and economy.
Your argument is baseless and thus I will not go back n forth with you. You hate yourself so much that's why you hate other black people. The economy is controlled by WMC the ANC are the administrators Wake up

We are getting the same. Forced to take leave living alone in a small unit is not a holiday, won't help the economy and detrimental to mental health. The budget problems will outlast the lockdown. Better.that we take leave shortly after the lockdown.

We need rapid testing. Waiting 14 days for results is why we are now at a 30 day lock down of our economy! Protect our first responders with a rapid 2-10 minute blood test! @ AytuBioscience @ RobLowTV @ denverpost
the other way around actually, its because you have an economy that you have health
Tanking the worlds economy is the number 1 goal. Whilst pumping as much money into the “health” care sector to build up their death / money making machines.
President @ realDonaldTrump Please open our economy soon. We cannot stay in this state. The Deep State is trying to destroy us by using covid 19 as a means to scare us into complete subservience and perpetual shut down.

It’s very hard to not stress about money when all your work is gonna dry up in a couple weeks and you can’t get unemployment
I would certainly imagine so But given the scale of job losses already seen even in similar countries such as Canada (11% of all workers unemployed in 3 weeks) that have an even more generous wage subsidy, I dont think enormous unemployment can be avoided.

The negotiations are not finished. Cuomo is a good governor. The covid crisis has set us back a pretty penny. If he tries raising taxes, ppl will go beserk bc of high unemployment at this time. Pot sales are a problematic issue. That money would not go into general funds anyway
Now add the unemployment, bankruptcies, loan defaults and business closures to that chart.
Furloughed trying to navigate the unemployment process. Things will get better!
More than double of those who lost their lives on 9/11 have died from Covid19. 8,000+ More than 10 Million filed for unemployment. Trump’s remembrance will be The 2nd Depression.

A lot will depend on how applying for unemployment during furlough will go, but we're fine at the moment. I also want to do my best to pay forward the kindness we got. Maybe another more organized charity stream, maybe something else. And I'll keep boosting folks in need here.
i am so confused abt unemployment i want to cry i don’t understand
did one of my 6th graders just ask me..... if i have found a job since i've been back....? ..... SALLY DONT DO THIS TO ME I KNOW I NEED TO FILE UNEMPLOYMENT LATER
Jobs report uses the pay period containing the 12th day of the month to establishment employment, so most of the 10M job loss was not counted. STILL, the BLS rigged the unemployment rate. Should be higher, but they dropped the labor force participation rate by 0.7%!
@ realDonaldTrump It seems that unemployment and help from the Sba is dream at this point, nobody in these organizations are responding or answering the phone. My vote will go to Donald Duck if this does not turn around very quickly
@ DC_Gurugram . Yes. They are our real heroes. I am very optimistic that as a society and country we start respecting all professions equally after this episode.

Yeah there will be a sharp increase in unemployment due to the virus and following shut down in most states.
Or the 10 million Americans joining the unemployment line because NO ONE gave a shit about COVID19 when it began circling in November/December and now it's a friggin pandemic. Our economy, our people, our nation, our world will not just "pick back up" and resume normalcy.
Healthy. Facing unemployment as my contract was terminated and we are in the transition stage.
How does someone who’s never worked a day in his life have the audacity to complain about people who live paycheck to paycheck collecting unemployment?

Same here. I think my solace is that it’s nothing we did and it’s nothing we could have prevented. I’ve only been emotional about not working when I think about how much I miss you guys. I think it’ll hit more when we have to apply for unemployment.
@ MichaelOher @ HinkleJ08 being out of work for 3 weeks still waiting on unemployment checks.. you guys are amazing!
The worst of the economic crash still hasn’t happened. Things are going to get a lot worse before they get better. People are going to be selling whatever they can to survive. Unemployment hasn’t peaked yet. This notion that it’s an uncorrelated asset hasn’t proven to be right.
How about you and your people take the day off and answer damn phone calls for the unemployment department......

If the forecasts come to pass—if we reach 25% unemployment—and we’ve not done enough to prevent mass evictions and foreclosures, what happens next? People are still raw from 2007. I don’t know the answer to that, but I doubt everyone’s cool to sit down and take another round.
Don't you just love CAPITALISM! People living on the streets. People surviving on food banks. People forced to live in cars and tents. Empty grocery store shelves. Massive unemployment. Massive debts. Rich get everything. Expensive medical; education What a great economic system!

Yes, unemployment + $600 a week, many employers realize they will be helping their employees by temporarily laying them off
The government is adding $600 a week to unemployment benefits. That means you get $600 a week plus what your state gives you(I think the lowest is $200 a week). If you can’t make $800 a week work then idk what to tell you
Problem is there are more people unemployed than there are people on unemployment. So, a universal 2k a month is more necessary than not. Not even talking about the economic kick from those who are underemployed.
i really lost a lot of negativity in my life and im so proud of myself, ive got a whole wife of a gf and i just got accepted for unemployment

Your ignorance continues to astound me. That is called a non sequitur. I engage in facts not conspiracy theories Trump robs charities, ran a fake university, has 13% unemployment, $24 trillion debt, considers 240,000 dead a success and YOU BELIEVE SNAKES CAN TALK!

Unemployment insurance is another problem. I have a friend that could hire 6 people right now. He gives out applications all the time but when he calls them back they never show. To collect unemployment you have to show that you're searching for a job. You do that by showing apps

Groundhog Day. Same old virus and unemployment shit as yesterday. As Yogi said, "It's Deja Vu all over again".
I think my employer got a loan through this program. They issued checks to employees despite’s having to close a couple weeks ago and advising employees to apply for unemployment.
Cuomo does not hold a candle to Rick Scott in Florida. The Unemployment system was broken in 2011 by tech designed not to work. Try getting a PIN #. Last raise in UE max was to $275 in 1998 under Gov Chiles who died that year. Still $275 except now it is limited to 12 weeks.

It says they hope to hire everyone back once everything ends. At least now the employees can file for unemployment where before they were probably working so few hours that now unemployment may actually pay more...

Assuming 17% of ~350M get infected eventually, with a 1% fatality rate, that is roughly 500,000 citizens or 0.14% of the population. This is a worst case scenario. The death rate will be 1% or higher of the entire population with massive unemployment/recession/depression alone.
Every penny of which has to be paid back by the taxpayer which is going to be harder given the cascading effect of business failures and rising unemployment. The austerity that is going to be required after this is going to make the last lot look like a blip.

Florida’s unemployment sucks at the best of times. This state is loaded with old rich white people who don’t care about the unemployed & under-employed. They always vote republican & it sickens me. Desantis isn’t worried about this-he’s only worried about keeping trump happy.
So basically the virus has sent the unemployment rate way up but somehow y’all politicize it to make it fall on Trump. Kind of like y’all had this planned since impeachment didn’t work.
that people have to deal with the unemployment system at all right now is bad enough, but legacy software being an impediment to access is maybe even worse bc of how avoidable it is. procurement really needs to change https://streamable.com/bc1ib2

Can't wait to see all those "top 10 programming languages according to Google trends" articles in a month. COBOL's chart is going to mirror the unemployment claims it's designed to process!
It would be easier if you hadn’t made filing for unemployment nearly impossible
United States has $1,200 to individuals $600 unemployment but what about us that are in retail that are making less than $10 where's our reward for showing up and doing our job even if it is selling cigarettes tobacco products out of a little store in Morgantown Kentucky
What I’m adding the conversation is that Bernie sanders wasn’t the reason that the unemployment was enhanced and that you have no idea what you’re talking about lol
You do know the hold up and issue with unemployment is country wide right not just ny. In case you didn’t now you do

2. Extremely undervalued are XRP and Silver. XRP is at .18 and Silver is around $14 and ounce... and this is going into a time of mass inflation, market loss (stock, housing, commercial paper), and extreme unemployment.
TRUMP GAVE YOU UNEMPLOYMENT MONEY WEEKS AGO AND YOUR SPENDING IT ON VENTILATORS WHILE WE ALL CANT EAT. WTF FIX THE UNEMPLOYMENT CURVE YOU LIER. AT LEAST TRUMP GAVE YOU SOME VENTILATORS THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE HAD STOCKPILED FOR YEARS AND YOU COMPLAIN WHILE YOU HOLD ON TO OUR MONEY
while she sits here ranting and getting drunk with my tax dollars. I’m here waiting for my unemployment stimulus and sleeping in my car. I’m so disgusted and insulted. I hope she gets diarrhea
I still wonder if you can rehire on June 30 and fire again July 1. I really wonder if anyone is going to stop that from happening. Whether it screws the employee from full unemployment benefits is a good state-by-state question, too. FL hasn't answered that for me yet.
Anybody gotten that extra $600 yet from unemployment? Or is it 6 months from now when we will see it.
Just a few things you need an Identification for: purchase alcohol, cigarettes, buying a house/rent/ or car, file for unemployment, purchase a weapon, blood donations, purchase certain meds, get married, get on an airplane, etc..... Do you understand yet? SMDH
We are not all independently wealthy that we can support ALL of our tenants?!!! PLUS, they are collecting unemployment in FUL WITH EXTRA MONIES ON TOP OF THAT AND A STIMULUS CHECK? But I’m suppose to support my tenants as a single mother of 2?!!! THIS is LUDICROUS
Florida has an unemployment tax for businesses.
This comes off that you are cheering the unemployment of 10 million Americans because of a pandemic that was out of their control. This is gross.
Gosh, angry bloke. I'll inform you. List of oecd countries with periods of high unemployment: Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Italy. I picked the highest unemployment and relayed the health figures, but really I could have picked any other country and shown the same point.

“Data Reveals the Stock Market Crash Is Far From Over” by Concoda https://link.medium.com/4yu01Vv9p5
So funny. No, the sociopaths did this PLANNEDemic to crash the stock market - which is NOT the economy, by the way. The insiders took their $$ out beforehand, now get a bailout so they can proceed to buy up homes & businesses at fire sale prices, like in 2008. Their greed kills.
The Michigan governor IS A MORON WHY ISN'T THE STATE LOTTERY SHUT DOWN SHE IS DELIBERATELY SHUTTING DOWN BUSINESS THAT HAS MAJOR EFFECT ON OUR ECONOMY FOR THE NOVEMBER ELECTION picking on Jo ann fabric, and many others yet this moron keeps the Michigan lottery open SHUT IT DOW
Exactly! Trump hasn't ordered anything. He's asking people to follow the guidelines. Oh yeah, Trump did shut down travel and borders but that's a good thing. Your state's governor is shutting your business down if you are shut down.
Like it's my account, my business, and what makes me feel comfy. Don't care if shutting these types out makes me "close minded" somehow.
Really your proud of the bankrupting and the shutting down of America with a fake virus? Telling people to stay in your home, can't run your business. Don't go outside? You must be one of those phoney patriots.
I feel this was a trail run....if the Democrats get back in power another "pandemic" will occur so they can create their socialist utopia. They will take great glee in shutting down small business and telling everyone what to do, ugh.
Some business men in Egypt were asking the Gov. to act like Sweden and not to close down and from your words I get that Sweden gov. Cant take this decision of shutting down but they want to ?
So all the staying home shutting down business is for nothing?
Sir please ask all Hotels to make them Quarantine Stays instead of doing no business or shutting down also use indoor Stadiums to train Nurses boys & Girls as an Emergency Requirement for the World will require this SERVICE Let's IMPROVISE & Get Going with a new Way of Living
Np I took business law in undergrad. My focus was finance so I know more about the money legal side (what happens to them after) than the shutting down of them. But I still think the platform would be the quickest way They've gotta be breaking terms of service etc

Are they in serious danger of going out of business and shutting down?
Because we have a governor that could care less. He doesn’t believe in stats or collecting info or shutting down non-essential business. I love Best Buy but I don’t need a DVD player right now
business is apparently great. interesting supply chain effects: their egg suppliers are struggling to keep up with demand, but a lot of their meat suppliers are _loaded_ with stock due to restaurants slowing/shutting down
Glad you all had fun! Don’t come now though. Our Governor & Mayor have been holdouts on mandated shut downs. Our mayor, verbatim on March 11, “Omaha’s open for business.” Things have been shutting down, but their trying to get every last cent til...well, use your imagination.
Again, a failing of the free market & business, not the government. The government did its job by shutting this operation down.
@ realDonaldTrump @ wellsfargo is late to the game for the small business “PPP” loans. Please find out why and get them on board ASAP! Some families who own businesses need the money NOW to avoid shutting down. Thank you
Yeah. Joey was on the ball calling the shutting down of flights from China as racist. Then criticized shutting down EU and the Uk. Joey needs to stay hidden in his basement and leave the adults take care of business.
I believe in the distance but really shutting down everything put a mask on and gloves go do your business even if you have to wait for others to get done with theirs before you can do yours! Whatever but don't bankrupct everyone for democraps to use as a lying campaign slogan
I don't where it will be worse. Urban hospitals are going to be overwhelmed by the sheer number of people. But rural hospitals were in bad shape before. Some are even shutting down because of the ban on elective surgeries, which was the only thing barely keeping them in business.

I agree, and I’ve said to others that there is something that just doesn’t add up, millions of people out of work, business after business shutting down, we all can’t live on the dole. The after math is going to be worse than the virus. China has a lot to answer for!
About time. Now we need to focus on domestic employment. Especially since there will be a decrease in jobs from businesses shutting down or going out of business. No guest worker programs period. Any business caught hiring illegals should be severely penalized.
If you’re a small business & shutting your doors / laying people off right now, it was already in the back of your mind.

They play something similar at the Walmart my wife works at. I don't mind private businesses making their own rules. I'm more worried about governments enforcing their will upon business. Like shutting them down.
That statement is not true. Singapore is not “locking down”, except for restricting travel from countries where CoV is rampant. Internally, they are not shutting down business activity, and are still relying on testing, tracking and quarantine to control the spread if infection.
Technically we're just shutting down the consumer bank, our business overall continues and is in good shape
Why is Sweden open for business? They are no worse off maybe even a little better then countries that have shut down per capita. Just proving shutting down doesn’t make things better it makes more deaths because carriers are with high risk people in quarantine.
I thought this but honestly not sure the dynamics would be that different to now, since business is screaming for money in exchange for shutting down.
She can't be trusted either. I don't know about the rest of you, but we didn't elect Dr Fauci or Dr Birx to run this country & were shutting down a $22T economy based on models that are clearly flawed. Time to reopen America for business as much as we can. Protect the vunerable!
Wholeheartedly agree, Patricia! What a difference is @ patagonia !!! They'll be shutting down stores and website but will continue to pay their employees! That's the type of business I'd buy from ALL DAY!!

I'd like someone to answer this question for me. Given that government is shutting down business for health concerns, what sanitary precautions are necessary for a business to EVER stay open? How logically consistent are we being right now?
The way I see it the virus is a fact of life now so shutting down the economy isn't helping anyone. Let those who can telecommute do so. Social distance, sure. But shuttering business that could potentially continue to contribute under a change in operational mode is stupid.
for you. How is it that the greatest business man in the world can be duped into shutting everything down, ruining everything, for the sake of safety? What you are doing is wrong.

Politically, I do not like what the Democrats are publicly representing in media with Corona, because it imply Dems feel we should be shut down as nation and blame republicans and President for not shutting us down earlier. This pushes many small business Dems to the right.
Arbitrarily designating some businesses as essential and shutting down others is ridiculous. Any business that can maintain social distancing should be allowed to open. Be creative, there are many ways for businesses to operate without putting many employees in confined spaces.
Yeah hoax. We are being completely conned into subjugation & a meltdown of our economy.

My company is an essential business and while I’ve been working from home for the past two weeks, we’re returning to work for a couple weeks and then shutting our doors. All the while I have an upstairs neighbor who has been throwing parties until 2 and 330 in the morning. Wtf.
Any business shutting down because they are “non essential” needs to find a way to become “essential” make masks or make gloves . So much PPE needed. Let’s get after it !
THESE ARE ALL PEOPLE THAT CONTRACTED THE VIRUS BEFORE THE STAY AT HOME ORDER YOU NITWIT. ITS ONLY BEEN 13 DAYS. ITS GOING TO GET WORSE. SHUTTING DOWN EVERY BUSINESS IMAGINABLE ISNT GOING TO CHANGE THAT
Is there anywhere in the world where it's business as usual right now? Mexico was one of the last hold outs but just heard Mexico is shutting everything down. Is there anywhere left open?
STOP THIS BS CURFEW QUARANTINE BUSINESS! You have No constitutional authority to do what you are doing. Shutting down our state is Not saving anyone. It is however ruining our economy. Flu kills more people and no one reacts like this.

But also, I think if we were given the option of wearing masks or shutting down the economy, most people would’ve taken the mask and gone on about their business. Most people were complying with guidelines before the mandates. Now you just have people acting out just because.
"Social Distancing makes sense... Shutting down business – and curtailing business from already open stores – does not." @ tonykatzhttps://bit.ly/3bB1yJX
Want a different strategy: Social distance, wear a mask in public, limit large gatherings, shut-down crowd events and keep business open and cocoon "at risk" groups. Since COV Arrived late into USA have data for that group.) We are not shutting supermarkets where people hang out?
me included. as a small business owner everything is shut for me as well. what I am complaining (as you put it) is that people are expecting the govt. to make them whole. There isn't money to do it. Could we have avoided this mess. Yes, by shutting down earlier.
Forcing people to stay at home, shutting down business, telling people who’s essential and not, etc. National Emergencies have always been used to subvert the constitution. We will never return to “normal” after this. Rights have already been eroded. pic.twitter.com/g8S6wDEWls

Shutting down any small business fro 3-4 weeks is not sustainable lol. You obviously don’t get it. 30k deaths from the flu last year the US yet my business did not get shut down. What are we going to do next year when Clovis is back? Shut down again for a month?
Government is evil. However it’s a necessary one and they have a roll. One of those rolls however isn’t forcing people in their homes and shutting down business. And that has nothing to do with downplaying the virus.
The government should not be shutting down any law abiding business for any reason! We have a different government here in the US than you have in the UK.
Everything is shutting down. The world moreover. It’s all so sad. Am I the happy medium. I’d run to New York City but that is commitment absolutely & a major situation at the moment. How is it everything in my world is shutting down but the “rose” is still open for business.
If yes, do you think that the world can go as far as shutting down services and business that would plummet the global economy??
China gave us this virus I wouldnt trust them giving us anything I would stop doing business with them completely They knew about this before Trump stop travel to China The dems called Trump xenophobic for shutting travel to China I blame the Democrats

@ realDonaldTrump The problem with projections and opinions is that's what they are projections and opinions. In other words is a logical guess. I have a problem shutting down the United States economy and bankrupting hundreds of thousands of small business owners on a guess.
Many black people feel the need to add “black” to everything they do. For example a person may market their business as “black owned”. Often shutting out the majority of the public and confining their market to the one demographic who earn the least.
Yes!...We should all be willing to die to restore the wealth back to the business owners that they have lost over shutting everything down. Now stop complaining, and get back to work...slaves.......MAGA!
I guess I should have been more specific. The full lockdown I meant would allow for all essential services and workers to still continue. But shutting ALL non essential work and business, and especially mandating that people stay home and ONLY go out for food and pharmacy needs.
Shutting down business briefly to overcome virus means 1-3 months lost revenues. For US taxpayers that means bailing out companies 2 trillion dollars.
Sorry Angela, but if Andrew Scheer was PM right now, Canada would be in a worse position with more cuts to health care and CEO’s getting bonuses for shutting down and business would drown alone with no life line. Appreciate this PM and thank God an unethical cheat is not there.
Yes. Skype is shutting down all over. The overall strategy is that teams is slowly replacing Skype as the main business communication app from Microsoft.
Ditto. Shutting down an economy and forcing people to stay home is absurd. If you’re at high risk, use your brain and stay home. Let the rest of the population stay in business

It will be interesting to see how @ corona navigates the aftermath of # COVID19 as a brand.

Democrat governors and a doctor who has no business shutting down anything
Government is telling you not to work and shutting down business. Weather or not it’s valid to protect you from an illness They are telling you to stay home and not work
You’re failing to account for the fact that: 1) Resistance to shutting business down would have been much more intense, with states deliberately defying direction because “federalism.” 2) There would not have been $1 of stimulus on offer without off-sets because “deficits.”
Even worse. We very clearly botched this whole thing. Wish we had taken it seriously from the beginning: widespread testing, contact tracing, etc. Social distancing at the level of shutting down non-essential business might not have even been on the table if we had.
Prior trump underestimating the virus spread curve. Let business continue as usual after only shutting down borders.

No. They opened up slap bang next door to an existing burrito joint. The general consensus was that they opened where they did to put the other out of business. Nobody went, while the existing joint had queues out the door. Boojum barely lasted a year before shutting up.

Every job or business is essential or it wouldn't exist. Come on America. Shutting down businesses was a huge mistake. It is not too late. Let's go to work and get America back on track.
The cost of shutting down my business as of today: permanent employees: 6 (with 6 dependants) contract employees: 18 (more than 30 dependants) what will happen to them?
@ SpeakerPelosi @ RepAdamSchiff @ SenSchumer @ AOC American's need 6 months of paid salaries & free healthcare. Every business & everyone is shutting down & no $ is flowing anywhere. Clients can't pay us so we can't pay staff. WE NEED HELP. Next bailout needs to be "For the People"
This is the 1% deleting anyone that can challenge them. Hunger games society. The real problem is going to be economical. Millions jobless and business collapsing. Shutting the world down under the illusion they care for the elderly and the disabled. They dont give a shit.
@ realDonaldTrump I voted and supported you hard but what you’re allowing these unelected health officials do to our economy with these crazy plans of shutting down the economy and stay at home is so troubling to me as a small business owner from NJ I think you lost me...
that I’ll have to spend my life savings trying to save a business that I spent 12 years building or just close up shop and walk away. To be honest, you guys got us into this mess by shutting us down over something that will be looked at many years from now as the largest
This is the 1% deleting anyone that challenges them. Creating a hunger games society. The real problem is going to be economical & its going to be catastrophic. Millions jobless. Business collapse. Shutting the world down on the illusion they care for the people.

So on March 11 when the NBA was shutting down, you think it was a good idea for De Blasio to actively fight to keep public schools open? Only relented bc of immense backlash. On March 2nd he told his city to go abt their business even recommending movies for them to see. In March
@ garyvee bro I have a question. How am I gonna save this barbershop, with Arizona shutting down this type of business?.
At what point is everyone going to realize a better way to handle this crisis. 60 and older, previous condition stay at home. Pay them their salaries, deliver food and medicine. Everybody else go about your business without shutting down life. Build immunity by doing normal life.

No doubt a mask is not for him, it’s for the little people. Like shutting down businesses is for everyone but him. His cabinet business is still rolling.

Re: per RWNJ fam we've never gone thru anything like this, no church, business shutting down etc. virus created by Soros/Gates to take religious freedom away & control everyone. They posted yesterday on FB.
Hardly any business is actually shutting down, it seems. I sell and install security systems and I'm "essential". The rest of the company does audio/video installations in theater rooms and they are "essential". This will change little I fear.
probably because they’ve lost business shutting select strores down and only having drive thru open- if you really gave a shit about your workers we wouldnt be open period thats on corona

Trump allowing Corona to kill the American Economy by shutting it down and forcing citizens to stop working is not safeguarding their lives. It's financially destroying their lives. He allows big business Walmart to be open, and force mom and pop stores to shutdown, suffer, close
He did a good job by shutting down borders and listening to health advisors. Just bc he may have said “ this should be over soon” to not worry everyone immediately, doesn’t mean behind closed doors he wasn’t taking care of business.
Because when business shut down l don’t think business will pay full wage of workers government only giving 80 percent its job keeper business are shutting down now just they sign up government program you could say it’s just like income protection
@ GovHolcomb how about if you do your job to PROTECT US by shutting down these business that are not essential, but are finding loopholes in order to keep making money. NO ONE IS STAYING HOME UNLESS YOU ENACT STRICTER RULES. DO YOUR FUCKING JOB.
Weird how Trump went from saying # coronavirus was a low risk virus on Mar. 9 in a tweet to shutting down the private sector and taking their jobs while permitting big business to grow and prosper. Truly weird!
Statutes are laws just as the constitution is law. The statute is written broadly. So are you saying the constitution prohibits the government from shutting down any business ever?
If this could be implemented, while gaining consensus from the ethnic groups sustaining this culture and shutting down big business making this trade lucrative that would be a huge leap forward.
@ realDonaldTrump MR.President I'm a big supporter I'm a truck driver and a small business owner I see your considering shutting down all businesses. If you do it will probably put me out of business it's been tough with the coronavirus .I think you've done a great job.
But social distancing is not shutting down business entirely like in CA. I agree with you and your post, that it’s also ridiculous but just saying that even with distancing we can and should open up business again ASAP!! # screwyounewsom # fyougarcetti
Please all those crying about my tweet watch @ TuckerCarlson about shutting down America over wildly inaccurate models. Business's have already closed down PERMANENTLY in my area that have been in business for DECADES. Tucker is spot on. As he was also yesterday.
If you’re into regulating greedy corporations like Amazon, which I support, why aren’t you into shutting down health insurance & pharmaceuticals? Why do you instead insisting on shutting down so much small business with # AB5 & denying freedom for people to chose their best job??
Might be something to do with the Constitution and the Second Amendment! Shutting down stores is infringing upon people’s rights. A dildo or hair cut is NOT a protected right! Besides, other people seem to think that they are essential. Some of them being states and Sherrifs.
Not really if anything letting stores stay open purely because they sell fire arms would likely open them up to more legal trouble. If a gun is now a necessity why isn't a dildo, or a hair cut? Shutting stores down that are not essential is necessary to containing this outbreak
You clearly don’t understand the economics of shutting down a business for 6 weeks. Rent? Keeps accruing. OPPD-MUD-COX-AT&T-payment due! Fire your staff? Good luck getting them back. Half these businesses will be closed for frigging good because you want to be like NY. # economics
I urge the U.S. Senate to pressure the White House into shutting down the country with a total Stay Home Executive Order & a list of what is considered an essential business. Take Responsibility for THIS country. America FIRST. Right?

That is a fair hypothesis, and for sure I get that people are desperate, but it's just not borne out in the data yet. Best thing for everyone is shutting down all non-essential business, and provide PPE for essential people before issuing (or following) this recommendation.
I think this is crazy for shutting down business !!! Need to be like Sweden!!!!
Our debt was the lowest of any OECD country in 2010 and less than half of what it is now. Interest rates were low and interest on existing debt (even now) isn't much over 2% of GDP. Obviously the UK can't go bankrupt. Austerity was an ideological choice to shrink the state.
They can all cut production, it's gonna still pile up. This lock down will go into the fall. This isn't 08 09. Also, c-19 wi become seasonal, so till there is a cure, depressed GDP as far as the eye can see
Obama had 3 years under 2% GDP not even counting the recession year in 2009.... Not to mention he only had 2 years average over 2.5% GDP. 2010, 2015. He consistently averaged under 2% regardless of the recession.
A simple fact not researched by many is the fact the GFC stimulus was temporary and was not baked into govt outlays: Govt spending to GDP: 2009-10 25.9% (peak) 2011-12 24.7% 2012-13 23.9% Note: 2019-20 MYEFO 24.5% # insiders

Well do fine without U
Before this pandemic began, Trump's GDP average was already projected to decline to around 2%-2.2%... the same as Obama's seven-year average after the recession.
How do you define "recession"? There's been GDP growth since 2009. There'll be a recession now, but Boris was planning to spaff money before the virus hit. What level would GDP growth have to reach before we started taking cuts to pay for Boris's spending?
In part because of their expertise in infectious disease, many African countries locked down before there was even a single Covid case. But they don't have fiscal capacity or mechanisms to provide income replacement. Avg domestic bailout is 0.8% of GDP
Again I reiterate, it's going to take a global pandemic where thousands if not millions might die in order for Trumps GDP averages to drop. If you think either thats a good thing, or that it means Trumps economy is worse than Obama's you're an absolute moron.
Morrison was talking about Australias’s per capita # SCOvid19 testing being the best in the world. Strange as they have completely dismissed the per capita measurement of GDP for years.

It's nonsense. They were trying to run a surplus in 1.3% GDP growth then they shut the whole thing down instead of shutting the borders - like they always blow'hard about! We'll be in a depression.

No. Increasing GDP is irrelevant if you don’t have a plan to reverse the debt. He isn’t just borrowing to inflate the GDP.

Exactly, biggest project in history was B-29 (yes, bigger than A-bomb or Apollo), Uncle Sam spent 3%/GDP, today that’d be $660B, less than a third of what Congress appropriated on coronavirus in March. I wonder how fast we’d have a vaccine if Congress dropped that much on it.

Just imagine what the economy under Obama would have been - average GDP 1.9% unemployment 5.0% before this virus would have affected our country.- scary!
Ultimately, without a vaccine, everyone will get this. Hopefully, before that happens we have some type of treatment. If we let it spread too quickly, we overwhelm the system in the short run; more deaths, more stress on the health system. In that scenario GDP drops by 10%+

2/3 It’s (i) as cheap financing as that achievable w/ Coronabonds (the ECB is backstopping the whole EZ sovereign bond mkt anyway), (ii) impact on each country’s debt / GDP ratio is minimal (w/ ECB backstop does it even matter?), (iii) countries in need of help benefit the most,
1/3 Let’s keep it simple:the EZ creates a Coronafund. Every EZ country contributes an amount proportional to its GDP. Fundraising is done via bond issuance by each government. Each country in c19-need draws money from the fund. It does NOT have to be repaid. It’s a subvention

The pandemic is a given, not an option, the question is what is the price to be paid? shutdown of the economy, defaults + public debt + monetary timulus in the size of GDP, to reduce 500per million of very old and sick people to say 100 or 150? I think the answer is No.
The additional government borrowing to pay for COVID-19 interventions will never be repaid. It will be rolled over indefinitely. Admittedly, it will, over time, shrink as a proportion of GDP because GDP, over time, will grow.
Says Danny McCoy @ ibec_irl "The deficit should “go as high as it needs to go. It will be in the teens and higher – it can run to 10 per cent of GDP, which is €35 billion. It needs to be seen as the first stage of the recovery.”" https://bit.ly/2wTsExt

Agree. People seem to forget that 2008 was such a shock that the recovery could only generate 2% GDP growth post-recession. This shock is arguably way worse. It's not the virus..it's going from an economy humming on all cylinders to a hard stop. Few businesses and people prepared

The entire premise of digital advertising is that it has higher ROI, that means less advertising spend per $ of revenue. Assuming GDP is “flattish”, then a shift to higher ROI advertising must mean lower overall advertising spend. The greater inventory has been largely uneconomic

No, I still stand by my previous knowledge. As far as I know, they get distributed based on both self sustainability and the gdp of the state. The funds get distributed evenly according to the backwardness of a state.

Sorry to be a bearer of bad news but the US federal reserve is estimating 32% unemployment and a GDP collapse of 30%+ within weeks - that's far larger than the 1930s great depression. The world you knew is over - including old truisms about ‘middle England’, etc.

A humanitarian crisis looming large in India. “Poverty will kill us before the Coronavirus”. India spends less than 2% of GDP on health. 4 hour lock-down notice sees millions of migrant workers displaced. @ AJInsideStory.https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/insidestory/2020/04/challenges-battling-coronavirus-india-200401183049774.html …
India’s current foreign reserves are more than 1.5 times Pakistan’s GDP. You should also send some to your homeland sir.

They talk about the EU supporting those in 'this crisis'! Excuse me, but haven't they just dumped Italy and Spain? Some support, and now the UN wasn't to 'support' them too by demanding 10% of their GDP!

LOL - Trump is trying to save the rich by making you go back to work to support the economy. He doesn't care if you die as long as you support the GDP, err GOP.
"The available seasonally adjusted data indicate that in the 4th quarter of 2019 the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in volume terms decreased by 0.7% in comparison with the 3rd quarter of 2019,"
Taxinda is looking at a long holiday. Let’s hope she doesn’t buy herself a job with NZ leading the charge to be the first stupid country to pay a tithe of 10% of GDP to the most useless organisation in the world, the UN.
Obama promised peace in the Middle-East and said 2% GDP growth was the new normal. How that work out?
What we are doing will result in far more deaths than the virus could possibly have caused even in the worst case scenario. 6% fall in GDP equates to 3 month reduction in life expectancy for all = 1.2 million lives. And GDP is going to fall by a lot more than 6%
What’s going to happen to the Countries that get the majority of their GDP from Tourism?
UN chief calls for 'large-scale' coronavirus response of 10 percent of global GDP https://www.foxnews.com/politics/un-coronavirus-response-gdp … @ FoxNews # AAG # AAG2020
GDP is $5T/quarter normally. When people aren't working, that number goes way down. The government has to make up the difference to meet people's basic, physical needs.
2% GDP is set to 2024, it is not mandatory - never was. The US spends 3.5% but surly not for NATO. It is spend for the various wars the US love to be involved. There is no agreement about 20%. France has shown Trump their stinking finger over a higher cost sharing.

GOOG is classic example of declining CPMs / increasing #of clicks as adbuyers deploy fixed budgets. The bull case has always been toll road on attention funnel, if this is correct, then stable % of gdp makes sense
I didn't vote for him but I appreciate what he's managed to accomplish: booming economy (before shit hit the fan), record unemployment, securing borders, high GDP, etc. Sure he ain't classy, nor is he a "role model". But he ain't been sitting on his ass.
Since cars purchased by consumers get added to GDP shouldn't their depreciation get subtracted each year? We are running a planet of 7 billion people on defective algebra. And why shouldn't 700 year old double-entry accounting be mandatory in high school? pic.twitter.com/ZTSZfSeIvI
They just want to take our $ h!t and enslave us, they love looking down on our farmers, the rednecks and truckers. I hope they can chew on their iPhones, and their GDP.
Its a pathetically sad state of affairs. America’s hottest commodity, bullshit, has taken over every facet of American life. Our Gross Domestic Product is our proudest achievement, American’s are willing to die for it, and it’s bullshit. The GDP is so properly named its uncanny.
its a small state in South Eastern Nigeria. with a GDP of $14 billion. small by land mass
Lest we forget the Obama reference, despite Trump growing debt and deficit - highest projected when not in a recession. Btw, has Trump even had an economic GDP quarter over 4% (pre-Coronavirus). Obama did, and he inherited a recession. All they do is spin.
Yes, extremely depressing, but that was the point of my comment, USA 20 TRILLION gdp, richest country in the whole world, and you're being told to improvise facemasks. Just unbelievable!
Trump said we’d have 4-6% GDP though. Economy does have many facets, but if it was “booming” it would certainly be reflected in GDP.
2% GDP is the set agreement. Germany spends a tad over 1%, the US spends 3.5% and even your 16.35% is too low as agreement is 20%. STFU.
The CPI is a fixed weight index. Consumption patterns have shifted dramatically during the lockdown. Chain-weighting would be more accurate but huge time lag to get the data. We will see chained GDP prices for 2Q at the end of August. # cdnecon
There certainly seems to be something amiss with current system where ~18% of total GDP is spent on it, with poorer outcomes by almost every measure when government run systems across the world spend ~9-12% of their GDP

I'll speak to @ averachia about us doing another session on state of the economy - keen to do it. Imports will contribute to inflation (one third of gdp), but demand pressures are missing and money supply growth is muted.
99.92% dont have C19, WH/CDC says stay home only if sick/risk (read it). WH and the Hill are willingly allowing Govs to destroy US on purpose. Govs are preventing workforce that produce 82% of US GDP to be shackled for 0.8% C19. Ignorant or purposeful, US Econ defacto STOPPED!
"Its okay because it may have been wasted anyway" Also the subs come as part of the 2% of GDP defence budget, which is the NATO required amount, we don't suddenly have money for public services if we didn't renew Trident unless we want to break commitments globally.

Sports certainly is a part of the economy, but it is not "major" compared to say tourism or food service industries that. This puts direct salary support at 0.1% of GDP, approximately. Even if you double or triple it for indirect impact, it's still small https://sportsconflict.org/resource/not-just-a-game-the-impact-of-sports-on-u-s-economy/ …
Economy encompasses a lot more then just the GDP, but I'm sure you already know that and just felt you needed to throw in your 2 cents.
Literally wow. Who would’ve thought? That’s actually really neat. Your country must have a really high GDP then
Denmark actually has little oil and gas but does so much more than we do which is why it's GDP is so much larger, its services better and of course so are its pensions.
I would really like to understand why Germany is going to spend 28 % of GDP, Italy 22 %, Gerece 12 %, GB 5 %, and we are planning to spend 4 % on our respective stimulus packages to kick start our economies. Where is the EU harmonisation and consistency of fiscal policy?
I appreciate that the PFA covers a broad span of players with vastly different wages. But this is a PR nightmare. It will play bad long term. Economic forecasting is up to a -7% loss in GDP. Worst figures since Great Depression. Time to get real.

Best debt to GDP ratio in the world. Hey over it. And that will still be true after this crisis.
This may be a difficult concept for you to grasp. The fact that SOME undocumented immigrants do not pay taxes does NOT mean that NONE pay taxes. Also, they are a huge boost to the GDP. In the long run, that means way more taxes are collected. We can speak economics all day long.
Wow. Literally wow. I had no idea of the relevance of Congo, you know. But with this, y’all should be top ten when it comes to Africa’s GDP. What’s the deal ?
Lol it's has to be a business that will increase the state's GDP
Apart from the 2015 election manifesto which wasn’t particularly anti austerity. Labour’s constant disastrous mistake was to not defend the 2008 crisis aftermath Labour kept debt to GDP as the lowest in the G7 throughout.

From printing a few billion? To free up the economy to get back to something like normalcy? For an economy with a GDP of $20 trillion? Yup. Makes sense.
Do you have any fucking good reason or you are just like those bjp dogs who lick and bark the name of modi each second. Do you know the gdp growth rate, political unrest, unemployment, poverty in our country. Just seeing those sold out media channels and making assumptions.
We give up that gdp. Just leave!

Footballers pay a lot of tax but in relation to GDP for a couple of months is a completely bollocks statement. If players lost 30% of their wages for 3 months it wouldn’t even make 1% of the total income of tax the government makes in a month.
It is clear from this GDP forecasts that they are not counting, the huge number of defaults and The surge of unemployment. As if printing money will help with economic activity. This crisis will last for years!!

The economy wasn’t “booming”. 2.3% GDP in 2019 isn’t booming at all
Yes, though it was Kuznets who created the modern definition of GDP during the Great Depression in 1934. Such details aside, there's no doubt that the fate of not only the world economy but of Civilization itself is at risk if politicians persist in overreacting to # COVID19.
Rubbish Brexit myth. A deficit of three per cent of GDP or lower is not an official requirement for entry to the EU. The EU could grant an independent Scotland a transition period that would allow the country to join the EU with an initial budget deficit of more than 3 per cent.

The world's super-rich hold $36 trillion in Panama, Mauritius and other tax havens. That's twice Amreeka's annual GDP. Even during a crisis like this, there is no talk of forcing them to put that wealth to work, for humanity's well-being. Hence Socialism 2.0.

Global GDP is about a quarter of a trillion dollars a day. W/ coronavirus we are losing about 10 to 40% of that per day. That works out to ~$25 to $60 billion a day. Building 6 disposable factories is a noise in this instance.
