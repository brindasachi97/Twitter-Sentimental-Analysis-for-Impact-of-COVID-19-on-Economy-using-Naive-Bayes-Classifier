I agree corporations buying all the properties are a drain on the economy but I do believe in the principle of an investment property and a need for rental homes. Fixing this problem and appeasing those needs is where it gets complicated

Masks are effective. It’s the dumbasses who refuse to wear them that endanger people and cause more shutdowns. The one thing that could slow down infections & get the economy open again is universal mask wearing. So those who don’t wear em are defeating their own purpose.
Trump gave a huge tax cut to the wealthy and to multinational corporations that resulted in a debt of $1.5 trillion. He also forced the fed to lower interest rates to almost 0%. This “juiced” the economy. The benefits are temporary. Our children will have to pay forever.
Fox Business said it’s a bad idea to raise corporate taxes and that it would slow down the economy. Are they even living in the same reality as us?

lol the worlds largest military and the worlds largest economy can handle defenseless families trying to come in, we can handle giving them actual shelter as opposed to cages. And immigration from Mexico had actually been decreasing.
And the multi millionaire ones with tax havens? The ones that drive down wages to make more profit? The gig economy that demands regular work with no contract protection just self employment? Small employers & particularly start ups employ few staff.
That is probably a reasonable aim. But doing it a time when the rest of the economy is taking a hammering is hardly sensible.

Deflation is not devastating to an economy. We’ve seen deflation in computers and cell phones the last twenty years, and all it has meant is higher living standards for individuals.
He hasn't said it is like the flu recently. Trump is not a wonk like us. The President's main concern is national security, foreign and domestic, and the economy. He delegated health to Birx and Fauci. However, when the economy was in a nose dive, he had to pull back a bit.
You are a desperate case. Have you ever read a true economy book (and Marx books don't count)?
"We need to live with it" say those at the WH, who get tested every day. Let the President,& all around him, bravely volunteer to get the same exact testing as an average American citizen.

I think that a truly permanent autonomous zone with its own economy wasn't ever gonna happen. But there was plenty of time and space that could have been used better.
The US economy was relying heavily on other countries (China) which is why Trump's administration is bringing manufacturing back to the US and renegotiating trade deals. Priorities differ when looking out for a nation as a whole vs individuals
And finally she would have never been able to build the strong economy that made taking the massive hit possible. However if you want Ghislaine Maxwell waxed she can help you out.
# insiders why is this China issue coming up now? Is @ ScottMorrisonMP using this as a smoke screen for the tanking economy and lack of action on the climate crisis?
You clearly do not understand what we are dealing with. It has nothing to do with you as an individual, it has to do with us as a country. If we don’t control the virus, our economy is fucked & lots more people will die. The only way to solve this is by everyone doing their part.
okay these twins are already breaking the streak of every man on this show being hot but then they have the audacity to attack my baby isaac? IN THIS ECONOMY?!
FDR failed at ending the depression. The mobilization of the economy ended it. He made some progress, yes, but he was nowhere near ending it
Not exactly, money is nothing more than a TOOL, you say “How can we depend on them if they’re the ones printing it?” When I say “our own economy” I’m talking about controlling the resources and socio-economics of where we live.

Name me a better and more lasting pandemic-related piece of research on the economy by one of those Dark Ages scholars with the brilliant handwriting.
In the 9th century, Black people enslaved on plantations in what is now Iraq revolted & waged war against the Abbasid Caliphate for 14 years. Though defeated, this revolt pushed the Indian Ocean and Sahara Desert slave trades away from a plantation-based economy for a millennium.
He takes care of his sick grandma? This has become another politicized shaming point meant to control you and destroy the economy. 125,000 did not die from COVID... they died with Corona virus.(per Dr. Birx) The actual number is smaller & unknown due to political manipulation.
Fun facts: Trump holds the record for the best economy & will again, the highest rate of employment, ending the war in Afghanistan, the highest rise in the stock market, & dealt w the pandemic that will be a model for other presidents to follow.

Hartcher suggesting that Morrison led with respect to the COVID crisis is a complete misreading of the situation. Without the state Premiers we would be in a situation similar to the UK! Morrison has continued to support early opening up of the economy.
Unfortunately that would be very unlikely, so many corporations use prison labor and are churning millions into these private businesses It's far far to lucrative and would hit the US economy if these businesses where to go under (1/2)
Cases are rising as the COVID-19 death rate is declining. We're going in the right direction. Trump is surely focusing on the economy but governors are forbidding commerce and shutting the economy down. People are hurting financially and emotionally and that's on the governors.

No, slaves did not build this country - the Northern Colonies did not rely on Slave labor for their economy or infrastructure, and the South was a comparative backwater because of their dependence on slavery. Slaves had a hand, of course, but to say they built it is facetious

Big blue cities are the economic powerhouses that drive the GDP for all of America. CA is the 5th largest economy on the planet. Good job
From AOSHQ: "Economy Generates Most Jobs in a Single Month In History, Smashing Expectations" > 4.8 million jobs created in a single month, easily the biggest one-month jump in history. Seems like something people should be celebrating, but somehow all the newsguys aren't.
My concern with a citywide lockdown is that less people will cooperate the second time around so it would actually be counterproductive. Plus it would kill the economy. It would take years to recover.
This new virus presents a very real danger to our society, and whether you believe it does or not makes no difference to it. We've seen the results of reopening the economy prior to having the virus under control. It hasn't been successful so far and won't be in the future.
A gate is a place of decision, power and authority where judgement is passed, it is a symbol of defence, economy and total worth
Is this death toll acceptable collateral damage to get the economy back to normal? Do you honestly believe the economy COULD get back to normal during a period of such great death, fear, and sorrow? Anyone who wants the economy to recover should focus on stopping the virus.
1st BJ principle: Ideology over Economy 2nd BJ principle : Economy over Lives So not as tough as you'd think -
We would of course manage, but quality of life would be poorer. Scotland economy likely to struggle, tiny tax base and huge challenge delivering stare services across vast remote rural landscape. Our deficit already way in excess of acceptable levels for EU.
I know. Fake news. Hoax. People are exaggerating the risks. And even if the threat IS real, the economy is more important right? The cure can't be worse than the disease right? Masks bad right? Until recently, many of the governors who reopened their economies would have agreed.
I see on Sky News Press review, English papers going mad “BRITAIN SMILES AGAIN” & “British Hangover. QUEASY SUNDAY” should be England of course but Telegraph run story about English Care Homes’ gig economy staff going from home to home spreading virus.
...soak in all that international talent. Let the Canadian dream blossom and create a knowledge economy that can replace its natural resource dependence.
Not surprised to see this. Government just care about the economy not public health. Prepare for wave 2. Which might even be worse than the first.
Many concepts fell out of the equations. Most of what you believe would have the opposite result. You want to maximize profit, which represents efficiencies employing limited resources. The capital created expands the economy. There's a reason the U.S. is a superpower.
Fixed supply is unworkable. Suppose btc is capped at 1000. Suppose your GDP this year touches 1000 btc what do you think happens to this economy? It can’t grow anymore since you can’t have a gdp of 1001. You will get a deflation induced painful contraction.
A 2nd wave of infections this month will be catastrophic, to the economy and to the NHS. I guess alcohol and common sense are like oil and water

Obama also created the largest debt load than all other previous administrations by a country mile, at $8.6 trillion. So how come he didn't accelerate the economy with that kind of stress to the finance grid?

The economy was definitely on a serious upward trajectory from Obama. I do believe he feels totally cornered right now given,the mess he's made which is why his incendiary rhetoric is in full tilt right now

The tariffs did not help the economy so how could it help the treasury? The treasury has been in a nose dive since he's been in office. Trump is a source of entitled bullshit because he is a dumb ass. If you are trying to divide us; you are trying to destroy us.
Okay, that's why they are shutting everything down starting last night because the virus is out of control. He better focus on that instead of economy. Everyone sick or dead is not helping America. That's why you are home on your couch.

The U.S. economy added 4.8 million jobs in June, easily blowing past the roughly three million increase estimated by economists. Unemployment in the United States fell to 11.1% http://ow.ly/jJNg30qW9Kv
There’s no such thing as equal rights in a capitalist economy. The system is maintained by the separation of classes.
Trump was holding his own, barely, because he inherited a booming economy from Obama. Now that it's tanked he's done. No interest in the pandemic, no interest in governing, no interest in our troops. All he wants to do is hold his hate rallies in the middle of said pandemic.
Herd immunity. And be careful thanking Sunak for the financial support with # furlough. Who do you think TOLD Boris (along with Dom) to re open the pubs??! HE did!! To "help restart the economy."
You know that the economy is pretty important right? I mean, you gotta be able to afford to eat, put clothes on your back and pay your Bill's? Financial difficulty and stress is a massive contributor to male suicide rates, which are infinitely higher than the covid death toll.
And your solution to that is socialism? If you have average income in the United States you're in the top 1 percent of the world economy. We're clearly doing something right and that's not to say that we don't have flaws
So how come pre covid unemployment was so much lower under Trump than under Obama?
I mean u could google what I said about unemployment. Kinda weird that any criticism of capitalism is scoffed at without verification. And the poster liked your comment but didn't address me directly. It's like y'all have blinders on.

Damn! Just when these people balling on that extra $600 of unemployment could actually afford them.
Two years is a very long time in politics. If there is still mass unemployment and large numbers of people lose their homes, Morrison is cooked. Pandemic or no pandemic, it's the economy.
It's not. Trump continues to appeal to the Hispanics and Blacks by touting low unemployment (read $ & political power) when we didn't vote him in and our vote wont get him out.

That's fine if it's going to those who really need it. Now what about the unemployed who will have no job to return to? # unemployment
True, I believe thats a reflection of the unemployment. Lower amount of taxable income.
Because they show and tell us every single day. Theystand for anarchy and socialism.They stand for unemployment check that aren’t needed, guaranteed income and free everything without working.The idea that republicans are racist and againstequal rights is your fake narrative
The US also have social programs Unemployment checks, foidstamps, medic care, scholarships ect.
25,000,000,000,000 in debt thanks to his irresponsible spending. 135,000 dead and rising from a uncontrolled pandemic. True unemployment of 18% or higher. A political party, his party ceding the nations security for donations from foreign dictators. And a vile being in the WH
But that’s bait, too. If the government won’t support businesses or workers being on unemployment—of course they are going to want to get tourists back... leading to the inevitable.

I’ve noticed ppl like to get on ppl who receive unemployment payments, like bro they don’t have jobs, without those payments, most of them can’t eat, pay their rent, gas or anything...
The answer is simple follow the std. pandemic 101 playbook like NZ, S .Korea, Japan and Germany.

No one should have to pay for medical information in the middle of a pandemic that has caused more deaths than any war waged and has lead to more unemployment than the Great Depression.
The background conditions -- faster economic growth, lower and falling unemployment -- are all pushing French sentiments to be more positive. But I'm surprised Covid-19 didn't push that down, as it seems to have done in the UK.
World war 2 started in 1941. 1940, the unemployment rate was cut by OVER half, dropping from 11.5 million unemployed US citizens to about 5.3 million. Now, I'm not sure, but I think 1940 is before 1941.

Traditionally, the key measures of economic performance in macroeconomics include: Economic growth – real GDP growth. Inflation – e.g. target CPI inflation of 2% Unemployment – target of full employment. Still looking good?
What nightmare? Record low unemployment before virus, now coming back faster than anyone could predict. Record high dow, now bouncing back big time. What nightmare?
* More Americans are now employed than ever recorded before in our history. * Median household income has hit highest level ever recorded. * African-American, Hispanic-American, and Asian-American unemployment has recently achieved the lowest rate ever recorded.

White supremacists always say that because Trump brought minority unemployment down to the lowest levels ever. Do you think being a racist will do you any good?
If it happens again, make sure they also sign a waiver to refuse Social Security & Medicare. Yes, we pay into the system, but there wouldn’t be a system if it weren’t for the Dems. Also, unemployment, public schools, unions, etc. Democratic Socialism isn’t Marxist socialism.

If people's old jobs are available, they dont have to pay unemployment to them. Thats what the early re-opening was all about
@ POTUS @ realDonaldTrump @ SenateGOP @ SenateDems If the $600 per week [unemployment insurance], millions of Americans will have their legs cut out from underneath them at the worst time - during a pandemic. People do crazy things, when they're broke/run out of $$$. # coronavirus

if he's such a racist, why had he done more for the black community than Obama? He brought unemployment down to record levels for blacks, Latinos, women, young people. Explain how that is racist. He has more blacks supporting him than any president in history. Explain that.

Honestly because they can't blame Trump for the unemployment while simultaneously pushing for even more lock downs. They'd also have to admit that before the pandemic the employment was really low, especially the black unemployment, and that it was Trump that did it.
We can see President Roosevelt feeling the need to address the deficit scolds in his campaign speeches at a time when unemployment was still in the 15% range, which was 10% less than what it was when FDR took office but 6% higher than the rate when Obama ran for re-election.

Now we know the consequences of a Trump presidency: mass death, mass unemployment, civil unrest, an erosion of democratic norms at home, and growing distrust of America abroad. Trump may not learn from experience, but voters do.
So maybe unemployment will come down to Obama's worst?
Imagine saying this when we're utterly failing at managing a once-in-a-century pandemic because we (and by "we", I mean you and your fellow Republicans) don't want to pay people unemployment income.

Wow. That's astonishing there are no economic measures they've pushed through — especially in a country with 10%+ unemployment. Would have thought the Covid recession would have been the perfect opportunity to stimulate the economy with job creation schemes, but nevermind.
Most of us think he is the worst! He inherited a growing, strong economy which now has a 11% unemployment, over 125,000 died from a pandemic trump ignores & social unrest he never addresses. Doesn’t sound like a leader to me!

Now show the real unemployment numbers and stop propping up the dictator in the WH.
my belief is, both parties are complicit in the villainization and criminalization of poverty. If we can fund social security and unemployment, we can eradicate homelessness and hunger in this country, via the state, rather than depending on the whims of the wealthy.

Now we know the consequences of a Trump presidency: mass death, mass unemployment, civil unrest, an erosion of democratic norms at home, and growing distrust of America abroad. Trump may not learn from experience, but voters do.
I am not american...I love Africa...guys do not make a mistake of not voting back Mr.Donald Trump...I have my reasons: 1. Before covid, the economy of the US had revamped greatly. 2.Lowered unemployment to new levels of recent time. 3.This is my favorite..I do not like illegal
So a fraction of America got back to work - awesome! However, celebrating those jobs numbers is about the same as saying you’ve escaped after climbing 25% of the way out of the hole you’ve fallen into. Reality still record high unemployment!
I would like to know who's celebrating with our money, no kidding but it's thousands of dollars per person already, I have 14 weeks, no unemployment no federal. 14 weeks!! Just do the math @ GovRonDeSantis someone needs to explain.
Must have been the lowest unemployment numbers or the first rising wages since the 70s that spoiled it for you. What a total backassward comment.

Due to these unemployment checks, COVID quarantine is the first time I’m making money comparable to my white counterparts
Fiscal stimulus should not be inflationary (beyond the 2pc target) if it brings spare capacity into use. Creating jobs is relevant because unemployment is an unrecoverable waste of resources and immoral.
Unemployment peaked. Now people are being employed again. So, it might be the same job, but they are now working again. So yes, these are “new” jobs that have been created.
Rhode Island. Mortgage delinquency rates jumped to 8.41 percent in May from 7.27 percent in April. Unemployment was 16.3 percent
Goldman Sachs now predicts,U.S. economy will drop 34% in 2nd quarter-Coronavirus job losses in the United States could hit 47 million,with unemployment at more than 30 per cent,according to stark new estimates by a Federal Reserve(DSP:LETS PRAY THESE R OVER THE TOP-BUT POSSIBLE)
52 is the most laughable in this list. blacks, Hispanics, Asians have higher unemployment than whites historically but, esp now, they have the highest unemployment ever in history 53 if, by wonders, you mean N Korea mocks the US because they know Trump is Putin's lapdog, suree
New Jersey. Another state hit hard by the coronavirus, New Jersey saw its delinquency rate jump to 10.49 percent in May from 8.81 percent in April. Its unemployment rate of 15.2 percent dipped down from 15.3 percent in April
Please let it make sense. If unemployment for black was at it lowest why is it at 16% now? So employers let go all of the black people? Then the question should be why?

Will see there's discussion of extending forbearance through the end of the year. But at some point it will end and with the record high unemployment I think we could see a surge of foreclosures in 2021 as you referenced.
Now we know the consequences of a Trump presidency: mass death, mass unemployment, civil unrest, an erosion of democratic norms at home, and growing distrust of America abroad. Trump may not learn from experience, but voters do.
2/ Hawaii. Another tourism-dependent state, Hawaii saw its mortgage delinquency rate rise to 9.30 percent in May from 7.12 percent in April. Unemployment edged up to 22.6 percent in May from 22.3 percent in April, for an overall measure of 31.90
We're in a shockingly mishandled pandemic and my unemployment is about to run out so of course i bought a dick mask to wear this morning
there was requirements needed to fit qualifications, most companies didn’t benign from it. It was too specific, for a good reason too. Why do you think unemployment rate is really high right now ?

1/ Nevada. Its mortgage delinquency rate rose to 9.99 percent in May from 7.97 in April. Unemployment fell to 25.3 percent from 28.2 percent in April, for an overall reading of 35.29. Nevada also was the hardest-hit state in April
The thing is...if state labor departments & governments hadn’t systematically underfunded and neglected the technology used to process unemployment and disburse the benefits...this would be a legitimate question. But alas...
Now we know the consequences of a Trump presidency: mass death, mass unemployment, civil unrest, an erosion of democratic norms at home, and growing distrust of America abroad. Trump may not learn from experience, but voters do.
So they magically changed ideals, of course because if they were known for what they really are. They started fooling minorities. Look at liberal cities, crime, poverty, unemployment. Many promises that never happen. More Republicans voted to pass civil rights.
Explain how it's his fault. Do you want the shutdowns? Unemployment is inevitable. Do you want us to open so our economy can recover? More cases are inevitable.

If he is actually a racist, I would say he has done an absolutely poor job at it. I don’t know any racist that would fix POC unemployment numbers and actively pass bills to help Black communities as he has. If you’d like to talk about a real racist, we can talk about Biden.
Unemployment is high because some people wanted to shut everything down. Hospitals also failed in their preparation. They should always have the needed supplies for a pandemic.

Let's start with jobs, lowest unemployment for blacks, women, Hispanics. Lowest unemployment for all at lowest rates in decades. Stock market recorded highs almost daily before covid. Removed tons of idiotic regulations stifling business. And on and on.

I get it, you want your unemployment pay to go on forever.
None of this behavior by your operator is appropriate and clearly falls under harassment assuming this is all true. Additionally, you can file with your local government labor department and possibly reap unemployment benefits.
i too see a nation founded on racial slavery and white supremacy grappling with apocalyptic unemployment, avoidable mass death, corporate villainy, a pathological need to imprison and kill black and brown and poor people, and i think: cancel culture has gone too far!

Fortunately we all (teachers and support staff alike) got our normal pay during distance learning, so none of us needed to go on unemployment and no one was let go, and for that I’m quite grateful. It’s just been stressful, preparing for the fall too.
There were no new jobs just people returning to work extremely unsafe Lee so many will lose their job again next month And they are still miss categorizing (by their own admission) and real unemployment is more like 14% Trumps economy was in recession in February

When people ran out of unemployment benefits, they were no longer counted as "unemployed". Just as those stopped at the border and turned back, were counted as deported. It's a game of numbers with Liberalism.

Trump has help the American economy. He had added more jobs for people and brought the unemployment rate to the lowest it had ever been. You know, til Covid came along. Which isn't his fault. Thank China for that.
You didnt post KEEP america great blaha whats great about this era UNDER THIS ADMIN 15%unemployment Taxing the poor while giving rich the cuts ,How about racism, the virus, corruption, police brutality, corporate greed, protest The riots,130,000 dead what part is great fella

You mean a disaster like 132,000 dead, a virus that you kept saying would just go away raging out of control, & 11% unemployment after what you called a historic job increase, & civil unrest all over the country? Oh wait, that's what happened when you got elected.

Do tell what part of Trump's America is great. 130,000 dead? Historic unemployment? Travel bans against Americans? Kids in cages? Shit health care? Suicidal farmers? Bounties on military? GTFOH.
This one is particularly humorous considering Trump tanked the economy and the unemployment rate is the highest in decades.
Hey POTUS ? Before going to MARS , where we haven't lost nothing , make sure we get our Stimulus Checks and People get their Unemployment Checks. You have Bankrupted the USA just like you Bankrupted your businesses 5Xs. The Art of the Fucked-Up Deals. Stop talking SHIT!
Right now the US unemployment rate is 11% and was 17%. The only reason it went down is because people went back to their existing jobs in a covid19 epidemic. Many will get covid19. This is Trumps fault because he didn't flatten the curve enough before he sent people to work.
Yup guess the guy that used this as his defense for how good things are is a beneficiary. Of note was his saying black people got jobs and off unemployment that thanks to Trump. Where did that come from?
Failed Federal leadership during the Covid-19 pandemic has left our nation week, broke and at the brink of civil war! Death and unemployment counts rising by the day. Food lines for those without jobs! VOTE! # JoeBiden2020 # FlipNY01

As the man who freed innocent blacks from jail that Obama flat-out ignored, who had black unemployment at lowest its been in my lifetime until the COVID lockdowns hit, if Trump's a racist, he sure the hell sucks at being one.
Nothing hurts more than unemployment. May more doors open for those who are seeking jobs and opportunities.
Oh sure. Your administration has done sooo much to mitigate the pandemic that other countries won’t allow Americans in.

Stocks can inflate even without stocks buybacks. The stock market is driven by speculators. The bailouts add so much money into the money supply that speculators speculate well on the market. This leads to the stock market inflating
Nope, the share value of Apple exploded AFTER it was able to produce enough goods (ipod, iphone) for their markets. Before that they didn't worth a lot and were not inflated. Here Tesla produces nothing compared to its market size, hence the hyper inflation of stock valuation.
Not lately though. The tax cut for the rich increased the national debt immensely. The COVID relief went mostly to corporations and unaccounted for. I do appreciate the stock market
well then hello inflation and bye bye stock market
Fun facts: Trump holds the record for the best economy & will again, the highest rate of employment, ending the war in Afghanistan, the highest rise in the stock market, & dealt w the pandemic that will be a model for other presidents to follow.

Correct. Other nations have shown: gov't needs to provide a 3-6 month "bridge" for workers and businesses. Once, you can start to re-open you only have to fund workers and businesses - like sports - that still can't. trump "juiced" the stock-market instead & ignored covid-19.

The graph and stats do back up the claim. Employment in the US has been rising on a pretty much stable path since 2012 (until March). Trump isn't particularly interested in the economy generally, that's why he's left it more or less alone. His obsession is stock market prices.

It is not capitalism they're protesting, they're protesting systemic racism brought on by people voting for politicians that would rather see a stock market reach all time highs by supporting corporate welfare paid by our taxes, rather than seeing it come to people who paid it.
How about better job number for his final 3 years in office than trumps first 3 years in office. And better stock market numbers. How about saving this country from the Great Recession.

It’s easy to grin as your ship comes in, and you got the stock market beat.
I will say I didn’t learn anything I didn’t already know, but it was a great refresher. I’m really in need of a doc like this but specifically a stock market 101, or investing. back to doing my googles...
I was at the Taupo markets in January and there was someone selling resin toilet seats that featured Barbed wire, some with sea shells and one that had John Key (presumably old stock).
Also, and you know this, articles like this are designed to manipulate the market. People who believe it will sell their stock, opening room for those who hold to increase their position.
No, under TRUMP the nation is dying. Only the wealthy get wealthier while you allow the country to get ravaged by a virus. Unemployment is high, the economy is down, people are dying daily, and you care about what? States and the stock market? Go 2 HELL Trump
...unemployment rate for Blacks was the lowest in recorded history. The stock market was going through the roof,and this country was on the verge of an annual budgetary surplus.Trump fostered prison reform, stopped the state's deductions at $10,000, so that they could no longer
The economy meaning the stock market? Two very different things. Markets up because of Corp. tax cuts period. His trade wars kept the real economy from improving at all. He made rich people richer.

@ sanjiv_bhasin You are true teacher of stock market for us. Happy Guru Poornima, Sir.
If you want 100% stock exposure then put 65% into VTI and 35% into VEU and rebalance it back to that proportion annually. You will have a globally diversified portfolio at a low cost. Never try to time the market. Add to it as you can afford by paying yourself first. Happy 4th!
Nope, just taken us to the cleaners. And every 10 years or so crash the housing market, stock market, economy, job market etc (NAFTA). Its always been some scam
Antarctica is actually my boyfriend is the stock market.
Best economy in 35 years just not according to job growth, GDP growth or the stock market?
The coronavirus recession, also known as the COVID-19 recession, or the Great Lockdown,is a major global recession which arose as an economic consequence of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The first major sign of the coronavirus recession was the 2020 stock market crash on 20 Feb
Obama created more jobs in his last 3 yrs than Trumps 3 yrs The GDP has not gone over 3% He said the tax cuts would increase to 4 to 6% never happened. Obama stock market gains higher than Trumps Unemployment was already on a downward trajectory
That’s about it, in 3 1/2 years, it’s his only major accomplishment. And even that, it’s not like he had to turn it around. Both the markets and the unemployment rate were both steadily improving under Obama already, particularly the stock market. So his accomplishments are few.

I got this answer: before the pandemic started the economy and jobs were the best they have been in many years. Especially for black people. Unemployment the lowest its ever been for them. Stock market, some of the highest highs especially over the Obama administration.
All that nonsense about being successful is such a bullshit. Just because you woke before the stock market or your neighbor or whatever else doesn't make you rich. Being your own lazy broke ass - is the true wealth as long as you happy with. I'm a successful person btw lol

I don't think it's the ultimate economic indicator. Maybe a contributing factor but not the penultimate. I could be wrong but how many people are actually trading in the stock market? The % will definitely be smaller compared to the pop. of people who don't esp. the unemployed.

That may be but wealth in that case is relative. We have serious food insecurity here in this country rarely ever talked about. We have huge rise in homelessness here too. The stock market could care less about it not could the asset class.

Jeff sold $3.5bn worth of stock in Feb
He never locked them down to begin with. It was all up to the states. All he did is moan about the stock market. Then, after two months, he decided it was suddenly all up to him, botched the reopening as bad as the initial response and now he's making the same mistakes again.
If this were a closed system, yes 100 would mean all were in. But this is not a closed system. No stock market is a closed system. People can add to positions. Stock buy backs. New money moving from one market to miners. Mining stocks are perhaps 1 to 2% of all equities.

Why the stock market keeps going up.
Good point but I heard this concept: stock market crashes every 10 years. There might be some truth to it especially considering the last meltdown was in 2008.
Some people feel like they don’t have enough to start investing in the stock market. I’m here to tell you that any amount is better than nothing, and you can continue adding to your portfolio as you save. $10, $100, $1000 is better than no dollars in the stock market.
Unemployment has to be looked at in terms of a livable wage. Economic gains have to be looked at in terms of impact on the middle & lower classes, not just the stock market. It has to be acknowledged that gains started under Obama and his quarters compared to Trump’s. Same rules.
Mane lol Ye a walking stock market
Yet those jobs didnt come back and Obama/Biden did much better on the stock market.
The stock market is not the economy, and the real economy is in the tank, in large part due to your incompetence in handling the pandemic.

Move to American with your racists self. Trump has done little and even before the Pandemic sweeping the U.S millions in the U.S. lost jobs. He lies about the Economy all the time while the Stock market Crashes. He doesn't care about American lives just money. Ford is emulating-
taxes for the 1% rich, let’s skip that. jobs and stock market: inherited from obama and driven into the ground by trumps lack of leadership in Jan 2020. trade deals: you mean americans paying duties on china tariffs or the billions of compensation for us farmers?
All you people that are worried about the stock market because crooked trump fraudulently inflated the market with unwarrented tax cuts and lowering of interest rates and he will be losing in November. Dont worry. The stock market is wanting a steady hand now and not chaos.
So covid is killing americans and 45 is more concerned about the stock market than the American people. And your concerned about some racist statues that can be placed in a museum and seen instead of a constant reminder of just how racially one sided this country was/is

But most people don't actually have a notion of what the economy *is*. There's their own personal experience, and then...what? If they have money invested in some way, odds are pretty good the stock market (and thus the DJIA) is their impression of the economy.
I worry about the stock markets. There seems to be a disconnect between the tragedy that has been unfolding in the US and globally, and the soar in the markets. Why are the markets soaring? I suspect the Trump admin are manipulating the stock markets.

Uhhhhhhh did you see what Trump did with jobs and stock market? (Before the plandemic) Record numbers for the dow 29,551 literaly adding a 1/3 of what obamas stock market was valued at. So it would screw the economy and you dont care because the TV told you orange man bad

That’s why the stock market doesn’t GAF about what is happening to most Americans. Powell discretely injected $4 trillion into Wall Street between Sept and Dec (pre-Covid) to prop up the illusion of prosperity. Our dollar is get destroyed (stolen) to prop up Trump’s mirage.
Trillions of dollars that would’ve been available to the normal people of our country in the world from housing values to the stock market, they would steal every time they crashed the economy or the housing market, or other industries. All that money should be returned equally

Wow. If you think about everything they’ve done to us just in the last 30 or 40 years with a couple of stock market crashes, the housing crisis of 2008, they make trillions of dollars while the rest of the people lose their savings or 401(k) or or even homes. Trump knows this.
Have you ever looked at the budgets of these companies? Being worth billions doesn't mean that is actually what you have on hand. Like most companies, that worth is determined by the stock market, rather than actually income/expenses. Airlines spend billions to make billions.
How much more money can trump put into WALL Street until we run out.? He can't keep the stock market up for too much longer.
Your deceit falls to the fact that although you are "a stable genius", you refuse to understand the "per capita" aspect, and realize that people's lives are worth as much as the Stock Market is! Hence it is because of your lack of cohesive leadership, that so many more will die.

We're at 20% unemployed, 100k dead from COVID, Trump got Impeached, he let Epstein die, his approval rating is (way below Obama), he hides in bunkers while Americans loot the streets, he can't fill 1 arena with people, and his stock market needed $6 Trillion in stimulus. Wow!

Something many people don't realize is Trump has pumped $11.08 TRILLION into the stock market since January 2020! Ensuring that while America may go broke, he personally will not. The stock market is absolutely not an indicator of a healthy economy. That goes double under Trump.
Believe Stephen Moore - again? He made the same "stimulate the economy" argument with $4-$5 trillion in business tax cuts, free loans and grants. Corporations used it to pump profits, assets, reward execs and shareholders. It pumped the stock market but did little for employees

No, that's literally it. He doesn't care if anyone lives or dies so long as "his numbers" look good. Because higher numbers means more lockdowns/closures which means a stock market drop which means the billionaires propping him up get pissed.
The lesson of Gorge Soros, he sells all his stocks. People see their stocks going down they sell. When almost to the end, Soros, buys back his stock and other peoples for pennies on the dollar. Stock market crashed in England like this and it was Soros who made it happen.

Lockdown got lifted for the county Portland is in, but there’s a lot of talk going on about that county and several others shutting lobbies and business back down to some degree.
These places AREN’T shutting down on their own. It’s a matter of occupancy. If the business is there(it is) they’re staying open. The Gov is the only one shutting anyone down and that’s Political and Fiscal suicide. No choice but to stay open
Shutting down factories, retooling, building supply chains from scratch is, like, hard and expensive. And requires you to abandon ongoing business. And incredibly risky because Trump refuses to provide a guaranteed customer for the masks. And demand, some day, will go "poof!"
@ OregonGovBrown Also you need to let other important figures know. To tell people to come on down to China Town were open for business without a mask on, just because they disagreed with President Trump shutting down travel, this type of behavior only encourages certain death.

No. Gradual re-opening will NOT hurt businesses nearly as badly as being too fast and then shutting down again. Just about every business leader I have read/listened to, admits that.

It's a way to excuse shutting down businesses over something they have little to no control over. Yeah and a business desperate for survival is going to actively discourage people from wearing a mask. That is so stupid I'm ashamed for you that I have to point that out.

@ SBAgov how come burocracy will make me lose my business and the way to support my family I don’t know how @ realDonaldTrump doesn’t see what’s happening, they duplicated my application and there is no way that someone can help me with my problem that is causing me shutting down
But @ GavinNewsom gets to keep his wineries open after shutting down all the others and killing business once again for everyone else in California # RecallGavin2020 do as I say not as I do Gavin Newsom !!https://twitter.com/GavinNewsom/status/1278688025686339584 …
I have supported your presidency from your campaign till NOW. going to Mount Rush- more & no masks or soc. distancing? We are in a mess in covid -19 and shutting down business' to save lives and slow spread for medical staff. You just lost our states support I'll make sure.
What i meant with “shutdown” was closing a business for a period of time. Shutting down =/ bankrupcy.
Newsom shutting down restaurants “effective immediately” in the middle of the day this past Wednesday is reckless towards business and people’s livelihoods. A warning should have been given.
With those facts stated i am currently requesting that the state of oregon compensate me in the amount of 1 million USD for lost wages, emotional distress, for shutting my options of corporate gains by way of personal business through food service which is my trade.
With these numbers increasing & business shutting down again .. I hold on taking flights
Closing a business for non-compliance with a regulation doesn't violate the 4th amendment. If it did, we wouldn't have state health departments shutting down restaurants for health code violations. They don't even need probable cause to search. They just show up.
$500 billion is never a rounding error. 3% GDP loss is what we’re projecting this year, which is roughly $600 billion. Point is if we e force social distancing, masks, increased testing and contact tracing, we can open and reduce both costs. If we don’t, this will go on and on.
so like, sun-orbiting compute clusters? but it's not the computation *by itself* that is valuable, right? wouldn't the GDP be captured by the people who designed the computation and the customers who enjoy the resulting output of the computation?
Basically you gotta give in order to get. If millions of ex prisoners were to become GDP builders and have actual high wages to where you get a % of it for years to come, it can be a huge multiplier of wealth for them and makes their interest in helping them get good jobs.
Neither Trump nor Obama has reached 3.5%. Or 3% for that matter. I only talked about 3.5% when you switched the subject to quarterly GDP growth and showed that Trump had reached 3.5% and Obama had reached higher than 3.5%.

The relevant question is not the price of energy (the marginal cost of energy) but the quantity of it. Unless the on-Earth and off-Earth economies used drastically different technologies, energy-to-GDP would have to be comparable within an order of magnitude.

Too bloody right Britain only exports 4.5 per cent of our GDP to the EU.Let us buy British as a loyal independent nation. For queen and country.

Yeah. I heard that too. Tells you how desperate they are. Tax revenue is falling while the deficit is increasing due to stimulus. We're already looking at a $4T deficit, up from $1T last year. To make matters worse, GDP is dropping so the debt-to-gdp ratio is skyrocketing.

My point is that central bank policies of accepting low GDP growth and redistributing wealth upward have directly led to increased support for socialist ideas and redistribution back downward. The correct solution to this is a matter of opinion. I was just observing the problem.
Hu really got so many Indian companies under his tweet. Frankly, India will never be the United States, at least India must first catch up with China, while India’s GDP only 20% of that of China with the same population. But India was much advanced than China 40 years ago. Why?

Scotland's GDP is similar to that of Greece and Hungary. Remembering how the EU has treated those countries over the last 10 years, you can be assured that Scotland would NEVER be treated as an equal partner. But you carry on, chum.

Sadly Canada has no strong leaders. Our leaders in my opinion just pander to special interest groups, its not hard to see. All they do is what their told and cannot think critically again, in my opinion. Canada is at 115% to GDP and downgraded to AA+. Let's keep spending!
If the impact of COVID-19 wasn't enough, We still haven't concluded a post-Brexit trade deals with the EU and USA. If 2020 GDP declines by 10%, it means that we will have £4-5 billion less to spend on Defence. That's a scary number. 18/20
2/2 I'm not saying pedal to the metal stimulus spending - but *something* more than we have. We have a *very* low debt:GDP ratio compared to the OECD average. In fact Moody's reason for downgrading our debt in 2011(?) was our *hesitation* to continue borrowing. Not total debt.
Inflation target is a bad term, it should be inflation ceiling and is equal to GDP growth. Inflation taxes cash balances and not wealth (hard assets). Inflation will mainly impact the middle class. Lower inflation boosts savings and investment, higher boosts consumerism.

To the extent we have much larger securities issuance- and more relevant the net issuance across corporate bonds, MBS, equities, converts and especially treasuries. If you strip out fed purchases - the US is still the largest net creator of financial assets this year as % of gdp
There's always a funding source. If it comes from deficit-spending, which I'm fine with, the source is GDP itself because, as you say, it's dependent on what demand production can supply for.

Without Democrats contesting Republicans, a fascist society could occur. And Democrats make up a large chunk of americas GDP, so without them, we wouldn't be as powerful.
GDP does not represent standard of living. The US is the richest country in the world yet 28 million Americans have no medical insurance and some 500 million are homeless so I don’t see your point.

All can raise money very cheaply, UK debt level was falling towards to 60% but we live in a world where debt ratios to GDP do not matter. UK got paid to issue 5-year money last week Italy is fast approaching 150% Spain its around 170% and France 110% German debt rising fast
The GDP figures are gargantuanly bad – but it&apos;s the recovery that we need to focus on https://spontac.com/the-gdp-figures-are-gargantuanly-bad-but-its-the-recovery-that-we-need-to-focus-on/ …

Thank you, the same for you !
Well to a degree, unemployment up, tourism decline and economic slow down isnt labours fault, nor do they have a great deal of control over those factors. Debt to GDP ratio they have some control over, however stimulus was injected to delay/offset other issues, etc
Michael Beckley's book 'Unrivaled' uses a crude proxy of GDP x per capita GDP to estimate defense capabilities that predicts military capability of several historical cases admirably: Japan v. China, China v. UK, US. v. USSR
ok can plz share the chart of china economy i have already told u frst get some facts china gdp growth rate also declined sharply just like india from 2019
Fixed with a one time payment of .5% of the US GDP
The budget would have to increase to 2% of GDP.

GDP please google it Human right too please google that Freedom of speech, you know what that is ?
I don’t think so. The Germans have been quietly reducing the national debt over the last few years. The target was a debt gdp ratio of 60%. They got to 61%. UK was 83% before Covid. Germany has a better credit rating than e.g. the UK and can raise money cheaply.
I believe that the United States is the greatest country in the world. But it's not for the reasons that neocons and ince.. er, proud bros celebrate. It's not because we have a powerful military, or a large GDP. It's not because of any God or religion or race.
Not facts softboi, the reason the economy is doing well isn’t just because companies come here, that’s like a tiny percentage of our gdp, have you never heard of the Celtic tiger? Our economists made a plan which turned us into an economic superpower
They have the highest level of education in the country- and one of the highest GDP per capita
No it wasn't. The 1619 Project is pseudo-history. Slave labor was never a major contributor to total GDP.
Indian GDP was Declining even before Corona.
Ru or Trump camp, doesn’t matter. They just pissed off 250k folks—made them hate Russia/Trump more. Our pursuit of happiness & freedom continues, while Russia toils under oppressive regime w/ no gdp & Trump team faces prison. Sucks to suck
Trump takes office.. cuts large corporate taxes and gives invintives to stay.. job market increases by over 4 million in first 30 months.. compare that to losing almost 600,000 jobs by Obama in 8 years..Trumps cuts also increased GDP average.. soooo.. what the hell r u all saying
Priorty should be same gdp per capita as germany. And not ppp but nominal
india's gdp growth declined due to geopolitical situation of the world . whole world affected due to that sitution but dont forget foreign reserve crossed 500 billion dollar now india is 5th largest gdp of the world so yh sab bolke jise pta nhi use stupid bnana
Large corporation tax cuts and incintives under Trump have increased job market here by 4 million... all in first 30 months.. compare that to Obama losing 300,000 jobs in 8 years.. it also stimulates GDP growth..
Trump has benefited from Obama's economic stewardship, as GDP growth under his watch has consistently been between 2% to 3%. In 2018, it was 2.9%. Forecasters, project the nation's steady GDP growth to decelerate in 2019, dragged down by trade tensions slowing industries overseas
Obama administration confronted the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. It passed a massive stimulus package in February 2009 to jump the economy it was successful. The CBO in a report that GDP growth was higher from 2009-2012 in part to the legislation
My guess is that a state's capability to match US defense capabilities increases exponentially with its own increase in GDP or a comparative advantage in Defense (old Russian defense firms) - Imperial Japan only had like a fifth of US GDP

For more context, mobile money accounts for just about 1.4% of the GDP in Nigeria. In Kenya, mobile money transactions were equivalent to 44% of the country's GDP.

The centrist viewpoint, y'all. Defending the 3/5ths compromise. Acknowledging the inherent hypocrisy of our founding values but, I guess it's worth it because we got a hypocritical racist nation out of it that thinks all its human rights violations are worth it for the GDP?
Truth is, aside from all jumlas of modi...the facts are Corrupt UPA 10 year GDP avg growth : 8% Honest Modi brought it down to 4.2% with out corona itself. Since u can't defend this lets go back to 1960!!

5) Agree that GOI should launch more aggressive fiscal stimulus but only limit it to those with incomes below a certain threshold. It should NOT BE Trump-like stimulus that benefits the rich more than the poor. It's all about the marginal propensity of consumption to drive GDP
Thinking of how one might measure Gross Individual Product. Like GDP, only me. That could be fun.

Socialists also think the economy is a zero sum game, and don’t account for the fact that individuals have the option to grow the pie through their own productive efforts. Growth of GDP and rising quality of life proves this is a lie. And yeah, FED (government) makes it worse

most dramatic sell offs happen due to uncertainty like possible bank failures, '07,'29, '08 or virus that may be like small pox '20, other than a flash crash caused by trader in parents basement, when there is certainty like declining GDP/yield, price trends lower into hard puke
Our debt to GDP ratio will ensure that the US economy becomes the next Japan

When folks say "an economy that works for the people...", it is an indicator of a deficit in their Civics education. The "economy" can NEVER work for the people, because the concept of "the economy" was created by economists & is measured by the GDP. Solution are in policy.

I have too, Brazil and India. Where tf do you drink contaminated water, try drinking water in India? Maybe look up the GDP by countries ranking. If you actually believe “we are the worst country in the world,” you have only visited rich travel spots while “traveling.”
/2 Regarding debts, Syria had around 150+% of GDP worth of foreign national debts, and it only managed to decrease it to 30% by 2010 due to Russia forgiving its debts. So the idea that it didn't have debts or was self-sufficient is just a nationalist myth.

We Brits also passed a law and then spent 60 years @ 2% of GDP on the Navy to try and suppress the trade, and that cost a lot of Navy lives. But as I watch the Federalist Papers lectures on Great Courses Plus I’m even more impressed with the Founding Fathers and their vision.
The world emits over 30 BILLION TONS OF CO2 EVERY YEAR. At $120 per ton according to BP estimates that equals $3.6 TRILLION or $600 BILLION more than UK Annual GDP, every year. Plus where will the 30bn tons be stored. CCS is a scam. # GreenNewDeal now

UK GDP took a 20% hit. Families have to get back to work to survive. West End can survive. America is roaring back but I think Broadway is finished under Cuomo and Deblasio's catastrophic leadership. I'm several hundred miles away and nothing will drag me into NYC. Good luck, UK.
Hass le Pakistan ki gdp is layak nhi jo ye phen sake role pakistai oh sorry international baggers

Why is msm doing exactly the same thing they did in 2008? Scaring people about a possible Democrats sweep? The stock market went up for 8 years under Obama. Job/gdp growth for 8 yrs. If lower taxes ensured the best outcomes for a country why is USA so royally screwed right now?
The Cornish economy depends heavily tourism.. 12% of Cornwall's GDP, supports about 1 in 5 jobs to value of around £1.85 billion. Cornwall is also one of the poorest areas in the United Kingdom with a GVA of 70.9% of the national average .
Yea that's quite a start to an overhaul. Looking at their track record at overhauling, it's like hoping against the hope. 2 years back they vowed to overhaul economy. The results? A negative GDP growth, inflation above 13% and record borrowings. And these indicators aren't fake.
The GDP was already at its lowest for the term: 2.3% for 2019. From 2.9% in 2018
