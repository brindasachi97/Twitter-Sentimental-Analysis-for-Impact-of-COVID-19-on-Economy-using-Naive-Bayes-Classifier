He’s wasted 3 months dithering & trying to downplay the threat along with his favorite news network to Americans & the economy as a whole & now people are increasingly dying & the economy is in a deep recession.
It’s not actually... Overall death rate has gone down actually... The flu kills 40,000-80,000 America’s a year and we don’t crash our economy to save those peoples lives. Those tens of thousands dead, their families should be pissed we do this to save from covid but not the flu.
Stimulating the local economy with some @ redcow_mn
Again I can’t believe I have to say this BUT: You can revive an economy. A dead person is dead, forever.
I'm not worried about a thing, and I haven't had an income this whole century. I saw this Donald Trump/Gordon Gekko greed nonsense coming a mile away. Get the economy over the top no matter how bad the environment gets trashed as a result.
TN is also an alcohol fuelled economy.. Lockdown or not.. Tipplers are getting their share.
In an alternative universe, Pres Warren is building on Pres Gore's successful efforts to convert the US to green economy. Economic mobility has been restored. COVID-19 was contained through a joint international effort, led by China and US partnership.

It was downgraded to a mild virus on the http://gov.uk website on the 19th, four days before lockdown. It's a psyop to take away freedoms, which they have,and crash the economy -- which they have -- big time.

Just because stuff will be there if our economy disappears people wouldn’t be able to afford the food or afford healthcare or afford to pay their taxes because business are interconnected with the economy
When 45* saw that PBO jumped 8’ in the high jump by saving the economy and passing the ACA, @ realDonaldTrump lowered the bar, and he lowered it more by his unpresidential behavior until he could hop over it. Now he said it’s a limbo contest and that he’s the best. Sad!
That world would also involve changing work paradigms, and no longer having an economy where labor is bought and sold
Totally agree with your assessment of war with China. They released this virus and their intended effect is working perfectly; destroy world economy and cause mass panic. Specifically destroy US. Media driven fear mongering is exactly what China wanted and that’s what they got.

“The economy” is the Stockmarket or bonds or money - it’s a mathematical model of how every single person on the planet relies on every other person and how we all need each other and how our decisions affect each other.
I’m not impressed. I got 100% out of the market, too. It didn’t take an expert to see where this economy was heading.
Thanks. But whatever happens to "Americans first"!? The economy can be regained but the dead cannot be recalled. Only the living works in every given economy. "Balancing act" should favour the living.

If you had any clue you wouldn’t be making those ridiculous statements. The economy shut down because donald failed at his job. He wasn’t proactive and as I’ve said before he is an incompetent president. All he had to do is follow the pandemic playbook.
Good article. The world economy has not been shut down like this since the Great Depression. I don't think the impact is fully appreciated yet tho I don't know why.
Corona started in December in China, hence "COVID-19". You really didn't need any insider information to predict that once it started to spread the way that it did, that it would have an effect on the economy. As with most other disasters, pandemics, etc.

Strategic musing: US (and China's) plan is to infect everyone as fast as possible and then take on the world economy with a remaining population who is immune to COVID-19.
Yes. If we don’t have jobs to go back to this lockdown is irrelevant. Suicides will soar. No Money for the NHS. It is balancing lives against the economy.

Because they don't want us to find a cure for it!!! They want Americans to die. They want our country to fail.. they have systematically shut down the entire country and killing the economy.
I keep switching from rage at Trump & his sack of shit sycophants to knowledge that there's not a fing thing I can do abt this. Knowing I cld very well be next in this gigantic pile of bullshit as I die alone, Trump's buddies barking for my death to save economy.
Lol Printing naira notes doesn't mean purge the economy with the naira Printing more Naira and buy locally produced goods with it only. Economy will expand with no or marginal spike on inflation. Monies aren't coming from anywhere so it worth the trial
The pandemic has unleashed a feeling of collective anxiety about the economy, unemployment, public health and an uncertain future. The Trump administration’s inconsistent messaging has heaped more unpredictability onto an already formidable crisis.
Because that's already happening. The economy isn't closed. Nobody's banned from working. Restaurants, cafes, still serving (although not open because young people can carry viruses to older folks), stores still open. It's just tanking because of national GOP leadership.
@ GovPritzker Gov. We appreciate all the efforts, how come cooks and food handlers aren't required to wear mouth covers? We are trying to support the economy but that would be easier to buy pick up food.
The economy is paralyzed already thanks to the corrupt ny nj and CT governors along with the panic the msm has caused
You know what would be a FIRE idea after all this shit ends? To help repair the economy, we legalize marijuana nationwide. It would create SO MANY JOBS and make us tons of $$$

Because Florida's economy is taking a big hit right now because tourism is down, and if Trump rightly gets the blame, he loses the state which he needs to stay in office. Plus, Merde O Lardo is shut down too and he needs it back open; it's all about the Benjamins with him.
17 days we have hidden in our home. We have family in Italy and were aware of what was happening there. Reading, tv, computer. Watching our stocks tank because of orangeman. We are over 70, the hospitals would not take us. No, we don’t want to die for the economy. Fie on tRump.
So why hasn't the US declared Martial Law yet? This drawn out containment that people aren't actually following is going to take so much longer and will DESTROY the economy! Just shut everyhing down and this will be over COMPLETELY in 2-3 weeks
Define “part of the economy” and “reprieve” first.

Yea, unfortunately I agree, but if they don’t would you give Trump any credit? For moving the ventilators around, for shutting down flights from China, grinding the economy to a halt. I agree it looks bad and it doesn’t look like it’s going to slow down soon but if it does?

If we shut down the economy, our country may be crippled severely and may not recover well or not at all and we'll go into a depression worse than one we had years ago (not the one back in 2007 I think, way back in the day)
I do too, but I'm anti-Oligarch. Ackman wants US economy to shutdown, but happy to have his $2.5B "profits". What he did must be investigated by the SEC.

Given this a more targeted approach focused on hot spots, protecting the vulnerable and a less aggressive approach elsewhere. We can’t shut down our economy every time there’s a bad bug going around with a relatively low mortality rate.
I can’t wait for Trump to be re-elected for his awesome job on the economy & his incredible job handling this virus that China hid & then lied about leading to the deaths of thousands & thousands of people.
o no! poor baby - I am so sorry! yes whatever we knew about the virus seems is not true in the worst way - maybe the virus mutated or something - funny though china seems to say its under control and their economy is the only one actually growing through this
Clearly! And they are killing Australians because of their dithering, including the economy. Where would we be if they had started taking temperatures and locking down every incoming traveller for 14 days from Feb 1???
Not as drastic or far reaching as yours but I think we’ll be ok. We’re not putting the economy in the freezer, but definitely it’s going into the back of the fridge! You able to work from home?
Helwoe - yes for Trump? Why? He's fed the swamp, wrecked both the economy and the environment, and increase the wars. :(
Does anyone remember that time we shut down the entire WV economy because about 100 people got the flu? This is crazy, absolutely crazy.

This not the time to play politics. Some of the people who are praising this speech are not buying from those Vendors. When everyone is in lock down the same street vendors are without customers. May understand the economy at that level first.
There won’t be anymore debates. Biden has basically said he’s done with them. He knows his ideas are worthless so he’s just hoping that enough people die and the economy gets bad enough that people turn on Trump
We are starting to see the social unrest in Italy, many work in the black economy so are not caught by gov help, strangley enough Trumps $1200 to every household would work better for Italy as it would catch those not caught by other methods.

I don't know why they can't look at New York and figure out that maybe we don't have time to sit around and argue about details. Or that if they want to compare an economy without lockdown to last November, they're doing it wrong.
My opinion for what it's worth, we are in the middle of a biological war, where China's economy grows massively, stay safe everyone. Beware of Russia's propaganda too. # Covid_19
There is real resentment on the ground among essential employees. The economy is scary, but for most, the prospect of becoming infected is scarier. Immediate v long term.

My dear! From independence to 1986 we had even leaders who ruled for only months, Amin ruled for only 8 years but killed over 800k people, the economy fell. It’s not about change for just bt for better ideas which yr demagogues completely lack! Yes if what u say lack truth then
And once again, if you try to change that through raising taxes, they’ll just move to countries where they’re not regulated, and destroy the economy.
Trump has had briefings since January about what was going on and how dangerous it was. He didn’t believe it and it will cost a tremendous amount of American lives and a decimated economy. Was Biden in on those briefings? I didn’t think so.
But then how else would they be able to ask such hard-hitting questions like: “Do you think you’ll be able to re-open the economy by Easter?”
Wildly unnecessary panic about this. Total population affected worldwide is 0.015%. 98% recover. We have a 1% chance of getting it. Every week we hear millions will die. No where near that projection. Rotavirus kills more each year. If our economy is wrecked we have 100% problem
None of this makes sense to me any more. You've got people dying of a virus and yet others are saying they only have mild symptoms. It's obvious that it got here via people in aircraft etc yet instead of closing airports we choose to crash the economy instead.
Being cooped up inside their (sometimes small) homes, nowhere to go, lots of insecurity about the entire situation and their economy. - Yeah, I think it's ok to be frustrated at this point.

It has nothing to do with what "Trump" is worried about as much as health officials did a live role play on a possible pandemic a few months back before the virus and determined a healthy economy was more important.
Why am I worried about the aftermath of # COVIDー19 on the economy. Like what policies have been proposed/ put in place by @ NigeriaGov's economic advisory team.

nothing is going to put some sense into trump and his white house. he thinks economy is greater than health, if they die , they die , it is just a fact of live. his head and heart cannot fit in any other people. if it come to worse, he will throw Ivanka under the bus.

The economy is gonna rebound so nice with everyone wanting to be outside after this.
This is what happens when you use the prosperity of a modern economy to create surplus productive capacity rather than bid up property prices.
The shut down is major blow to US economy and will not rebound quickly. Plus social and life style changes., not a pretty picture for 2020.

This heartbreaking. Hey Trump thinks he can safely the younger ones to work. Hey @ realDonaldTrump getting this pandemic under control is much more important than the economy. Figure it out QUICK
5 years if we’re lucky. Virus stop/starting next 9 months. Trade restrictions with other countries because of Virus. No means of kick starting economy. Volatility in the stock and currency markets. Low tax revenue. Small, medium and multinational companies struggling to refinance
Strikes me that the economy might rebound more quickly if the Nordic approach is followed because there’ll be a stronger base for consumer spending to increase - people not homeless or hopelessly in debt and guaranteed their jobs back so more secure.

We've got the same here in the UK with Boris Johnson. The death toll will be way higher than it needed to be due to his putting the economy before lives, failure to prepare, failure to join an EU scheme to aquire ventilators. I could go on, but as with Trump, you get the picture.

Lol. Look around, people are dying and you can’t even find toilet paper. Also it appears Trump finally killed Obama’s economy
According to the CDC 60.8 mil Americans had H1N1, 274,000 were hospitalized and 12,469 died. We had no vaccine and yet the media was not in a meltdown and there were no calls for shutting the economy down. For those who doubt the numbers see the following https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/2009-h1n1-pandemic.html …
One gropes for possible reasons - forced vaccination, losing freedom & rights- have been going around. Damage to economy a collateral damage. Not sure how killing economy hurts Trump though. He appears to fight it best he can and his rating is improving.

not to mention the increasing disengagement from politics another shitty centrist who doesn't even try to change anything produces. Though, if Biden wins, chances are that means that the economy or Covid have gotten so bad that there's not a whole lot of certainty anymore.

Nigeria is no where messed up like this, current Indian govt is busy is brewing a heck of cocktail for disaster. Fascism(Hindutva flavor) +Banks failing(loans to cronies)+ Economy compromised(senseless taxation) + Telecom companies in crisis(due to this Vodafone leaving).....
If that were to happen the economy would fail hardly with everyone being taxed higher, leaving all of us in a bigger hole

Questions for Democrats, Lefties and the Mainstream Media: If it was guaranteed that Trump would lose re-election if... • we had 30% unemployment directly due to Coronavirus, would it be worth it to you? or • the US had 100K Coronavirus deaths, would it be worth it to you?

Unemployment insurance shouldn't pay you more than what your normal paycheck is. Unless you don't want people to work. When you want to campaign on high unemployment numbers that is what you do.
Unfortunately there are still some set backs with trying to utilize unemployment
I was declined for unemployment benefits bc I was going to attend school 2x a week for 1.5hrs & they said I wasn’t available enough for a FT job. I AM available this is so dumb. Why do they think u can’t work FT AND go to school. I dropped my classes anyways ugh
They will get better unemployment tho which helps

It's actually very bad for many small biz owners. I own 5 DFW day spas with high payroll. With 0 customers, had to lay everyone off so they can get unemployment. The loan is unforgiven for us if we have 0 employees during the 8 weeks following the loan. And huge rent is still due

It also seems highly likely that the 80pc measure is commensurate with projected infection rates - not just growing unemployment. It will be touted as ‘taking action’ while deflecting criticism of how they’ve fucked up public health measures. Media will lap it up
That seems a contradiction. Trump hires illegal aliens who are now suffering and can't get unemployment for lack of citizenship, so you'll never vote for a Democrat again? What am I missing here?
i don't give a shit that he's not a climate denier. his climate plan is 10 times too small to matter. everything he offers is utterly inadequate in the face of our current situation. will being "not trump" fix an economy with 30% unemployment? will it fix mass homelessness?

Raising millions of dollars for coronavirus relief, holding regular town halls with public health experts, fighting for additional unemployment benefits...I agree, he’s doing great
Considering the spikes in unemployment; I’d say there’s a great deal for whom this would apply. And it can be easily spread for the entire country if people really wanted it to be.
I will be getting $600 on top of whatever I am getting for my unemployment plus the $1200? Um yes
I don’t agree w/ this bail out. We should trust our system. If not it has already failed. You get sick, you leave work. You get fired, you get unemployment or workman’s comp. seek out your doctor on the healthcare you have. Nothing is free. I don’t trust the #’s.

Keynesian economics, its fundamentals and some of the post '08/9 modernized model. That is what is happening for the most part, but throwing thousands of public employees into the unemployment lines is a sacrificial lamb. A political/ideological answer to an economic problem.

Unemployment? No problem. Just sold an ashtray I made on depop, I’ll be making bank in no time. Coronavirus got nothing on me.
If they’re laid off, they can file for unemployment. Kennedy Center’s operating budget comes from ticket sales, of which there are none for the foreseeable future
@ colinAitchison There are several children in the Alberta education system with learning disabilities and special needs. The EAs are an important factor in those children’s education. You are harming those children as well as compounding the unemployment issue! We will NOT forget
Bitch just close down already so i can file for unemployment
The only reason it was expanded was because of this pandemic. In any other situation, it’d stay the same. I’ve never had to file for unemployment, but I expect to make something similar to what I’d make without this virus. Is that outlandish for me to expect?
Dear diary, Tested positive for unemployment.
and fuck me because i can't collect unemployment because my fucking jobs were federal work study which doesn't qualify
Good point. I am stunned at how fragile this article makes Midland sound. There aren’t unemployment and food lines because of 2-3 weeks of COVID19 pain. It’s because leaders like @ bmbrigham have built unsustainable businesses on flawed premises, leeching off workers for CEO pay
Thankyou Bernie , Thankyou Senator Mike , also Senator sadly had to file unemployment this week along with everyone else ,finally got through but now afraid won’t be able to do required weekly log in or phonecall to claim benefit as Dept Of Labor site and phones jammed ?
Im a server who has been out of work for awhile! My unemployment checks aren’t even enough to cover my rent.. anything helps!! @ samlynnconley
I’m officially laid off because of COVID-19! I can’t wait to go through the over-clogged unemployment system
-Stagnation is a condition of slow or flat growth in an economy. -Stagnation often involves substantial unemployment and underemployment, as well as an economy that is generally performing below its potential. -Periods of stagnation can be short-lived or long-lasting.
You want the ENTIRE country be laid off? Thats mass economic ruin. Only a percentage of jobs have disappeared in either sector many people still have their jobs and are just teleworking. Preventing more unemployment via financial aid is what needs to happen.
Thats nice of him. Why were all of your liberal politicians willing to vote on that piece of shit without those unemployment benefits?
Yeah our economy wasn’t that strong 3-4% unemployment, 60000 per capita income; 21.7 trillion in gdp without being a huge exporter of oil (like Norway or russia).
So. Let’s call it what it is: modern-day Civil War. He’s pushing us to rely on our State. And he’s still withholding our disaster unemployment funds. Hate isn’t a strong enough word, y’all. https://twitter.com/GavinNewsom/status/1244029584808402945 …
A record three million filed for unemployment. At least half relied on employers for health insurance. Thanks to the # AffordableCareAct they can enroll in their states marketplace and still get health insurance, just when we need it most. Thanks Obama
Exactly, because its just not as prevalent as media made it out to be. They want our economy tanked and to demolish all the low unemployment numbers to destroy Trump. However like everything else this too will fail.
Oh, boy! today was so much fun, y'all! Thanks for supporting the unemployment emergency among our # iabeer ranks by attending the # virtualbeerfest! # brewediniowa
If people aren’t layed off, are they eligible for unemployment? Seems like this is a population culling thing.
Yep. With the parish office closing most parish staff are being furloughed so we won’t be paid for the coming weeks we will be closed and will be able to apply for unemployment. I’ll have a job back as soon as the parish office can open again.
Exactly what I thought — sounds like a bunch of people thinking they’re gonna get extended unemployment to chill ... best to stay working if you can IMO.
@ TimRunsHisMouth HEY/YO!! @ IrvinJ DIDN'T FORGET YOU THIS FRI. WATCH, L.I.O.N EVEN THOUGH THESE HAVEN'T BEEN THE HUMOROUS TIME'S OF LATE. BESIDES NOT BEING EMPLOYED OF LATE, I'M TRYING TO STAY STRONG AND IN GOOD SPIRIT. WITH COVID-19, PEOPLE PASSING AWAY, AND UNEMPLOYMENT
It means that Most workers that get unemployment benefits will be getting their full salary - it means that cancelling rent argument is void
A small portion got the unemployment, the rest got $1250. What was that? An insult before you took off to hid for a month. How the hell are we suppose to live, eat, pay for hospital care? You all acted so proud you stood up for us. Damn you!

To be clear, this lockdown hasn't damaged the economy, it has wrecked it. We're talking mass unemployment, years if not a decade lost, wartime levels of debt, pensions obliterated, tax rises... The discredited Neil Ferguson's call to extend till May/June MUST be ignored.

You might be right that there's a force in place to lower monetary mass M2. But you know that plenty of countries had raising prices AND raising unemployment, right? I don't know the outcome, but Trump's wish of a weaker dollar may become a reality and bite us in the a.
Small businesses are typically close to their employees. It harms them to rehire for 8 weeks and then fire them again starting the unemployment waiting time over. Makes no sense to go deep in debt to pay them, that's why we pay unemployment insurance.

If you’re being claimed as a dependent then you won’t get the check unfortunately. Do you have to be claimed as a dependent? For unemployment if you were working but then let go because of the Coronavirus then you can claim for unemployment.

Another way to look at it would be death totals of the above if it was the same as Italy’s rate, 857k annual in that best case scenario and worst case of 4.725 million. More would die each year than the number who filed for unemployment so far. I think that would tank the economy

Probably, but it is a loan. Since my consulting went to zero, I’m looking at the new unemployment eligibility for 1099 workers. That was part of the bill as well. That one is probably only helpful if your 1099 income dropped below the max unemployment cap (which varies).

If you are a college student who has lost theirjob due to coronavirus and is filed as a dependent underneath your parents taxes... file for unemployment. This way you can get unemployment benefits while also receiving $600 for the next four months from the stimulus bill.
and meanwhile unemployment skyrockets with no jobs
Sadly, the bill excludes dependents age 17+ regardless of their education status. Even if you take care of an elderly relative & claim them on taxes, they are excluded from stimulus payment considerations. However, college students are eligible for increased unemployment benefits

I was on unemployment for a few months about five years ago. I couldn't pay my mortgage much less other bills. I was lucky enough to get freelance work here and there until I could find full time work again.

@ MikeBellafiore I had the exact same experience. During March I turned around a 70% draw down from 2019 back to BE. Last Thursday I tried to short the market after the record unemployment numbers and blew up my entire month. Overconviction & fatigue ruined me. $75k gone.

If retaining our conditions means businesses go under, and consequently members go out of work, we need to fight tooth and nail that they be supported in unemployment. They cannot become a drag on the EBA. If we trade away conditions now, it may take 20 years to get them back.
And I'm never, ever in favour of workers having to cop the brunt of the capitalist system crashing, plunging too many workers into unemployment. And so, onto the strategy for unions. This will be a test. Bosses will put us under pressure to help businesses stay afloat.

They fired the musicians, so the musicians can file for unemployment and get 4+ months of unemployment. I’d be shocked if the Kennedy Center was obligated to keep their staff employed like other companies/industries receiving aid.
That I completely agree with. If you don't work and don't pay taxes, you don't deserve that money. The people who claim unemployment and/or disability already get a check every month. Meanwhile I worked all of 2019 and paid taxes this past year. Got my tax return back and all

He should lay them off with the option for recall.. they'd get unemployment plus the supplement during the shut down
That's entirely possible under an administration that wanted states to delay releasing their unemployment figures until the feds could figure how to spin them. If they would do that with live bodies think what they would do with dead one. You cannot trust your life to Trump
Everybody seems to want stuff just handed to them these days and this stimulus crap just going to everyone just reinforces that belief. They should just use the money to boost unemployment. That way it just goes to who needs it. Make sure they can continue to pay their bills.

1. There will be days ahead where there are 1000s of daily Covid-19 deaths—maybe even 10s of 1000s. 2. The unemployment rate will be (much) higher than at any time since the 1930s. And I fear much darker tertiary effects—tho I see these as lower (but alas not tiny) probability.
You expect me to believe YOU ALONE fought for unemployment insurance expansion and small business support—AFTER you shot down the first go ‘round? Nope! You don’t care about the people, you care about the Kennedy Center and the Arts while people don’t eat.
The logic you are employing is that more government is the solution to all problems...that makes you a Bond villain. Here is a thought experiment. Once the four months of enhanced unemployment have lapsed...where do people go back to work? Government is making a bad situation

http://Paypal.me/jessa88ica anything helps!! Laid off from job and waiting on unemployment
I hope your job doesn’t involve math. I live in Florida. Unemployment is like $275 a week. Now it would be like $875 a week (after taxes and no health insurance) closer to $550. Take home. I have no clue how that adds up to $100k Even MA (highest) is $650=$1250=$65K
What in-built incentives to work do you propose? If unemployment returns to 5% what incentive is there for that 22year old unskilled workers to actually work if the pay is the same either way? What about inflationary pressure?
But he gets the job done though mate. America first then other countries and look at them now. Unemployment the lowest ever, production up and he does what he preaches unlike our look with the fake promises
I can’t find this, but y’all may be eligible for unemployment. Part-time employees (who got laid off? Not sure if that’s a requirement) are eligible for $600 a week as a part of the stimulus package. And your state may chip more in as well
No unemployment for her. lol
I believe individuals should make that choice. Let Congress pass the Medicare Option for ALL, & lets see what happens. Erasing 16% of GDP, by forcibly eliminating private insurance will be disastrous. The unemployment surge will flip D.C., & ensure a repeal when @ GOP recovers.
I wish you would stay home like the rest of us and having to try and file for unemployment and not be able to pay your bills and rent and whatever else that needs to be paid. this goes our slimy mayor turner also

its kinda funny how i quit cracker barrel at the most inconvenient time ever.... right before a global pandemic... and because i quit i can’t file for unemployment. still don’t regret it tho fuck the barrel
They conceded four months, full pay. Dems had been pushing for seven months +$600 (incentivizing unemployment?) I’m not sure what the original Republican proposal was. Probably some kind of “month by month” thing.
Freelancers, gig workers can receive unemployment benefits plus $600 https://flip.it/nZjMag
It's one effect of the unemployment crisis that we face. It's just another hustle. But things are so bad in Nigeria that it is no more by power nor by might but by the anointing that breaks the yoke. So they have a market that they cater to. People need these things to go on.
They’ve been saying that for years. If prepping the country for unemployment, who will the tax revenue come from to pay for all these freebies?
Can't you apply for unemployment? They were very generous with it in the bill. This $1200 is a one-of to help people out.
The committee didn't approve the $1,000 economic stimulus payments. Tilton said unemployment insurance and the federal stimulus payment won't meet people's needs. Olson also wanted it. The vote was 4-2 (2-1 for each chamber).
@ realDonaldTrump Let our banks help with the unemployment so things go smoother! Other countries are doing so and moving smoother!

Regular unemployment + $600 a week for 4 months isn't enough, huh? Well, can't help you. Everyone is tightening their belts.
My men thanks to you and yours.The Gvnr is doing his part no doubt. Issues with log n call in with unemployment. Call in get hung up on. Gonna be another week without benis. The field that I enjoyed seeing you play may turn into a home less shelter tmorrows important 2 word out
$kristinamarie95 I’m a single mom who was recently laid off of work . Still waiting to approved for unemployment. My daughters birthday is within the next two weeks and we had to cancel her birthday, I really just want to make it a good one for her.
the crisis where 3.3 million people filed for unemployment and likely lost health insurance among other benefits demonstrates why government needs to be more limited? gonna need some logic there.
I give a shit about his mouth. I care about results. Record low unemployment in every race or gender. Before this bs virus screwed the entire world.
And without hazard pay! It is absolutely incredible that the outrageous injustice of giving an extra $600/wk on top of regular unemployment to those safely at home and $0 to essential workers forced to risk their lives for a fraction of that didn't occur to anyone in Congress!
You all do know that everyone that receives unemployment is getting $600 more per week? https://twitter.com/27Teddies/status/1243960164949954560 …

The Press showed a sense of urgency that the president failed to do UNTIL the stock market dropped 3000 points in one day! Remember he downplayed it & said "Only 15 cases!" His refusal to aknowledge this & take it seriously is why so we were so ill prepared. WHY can't u see this?

What a joke! As usual, this was the trump show! He lied to our country for weeks about the threat we are now facing. The only reason he doing anything is that the stock market tanked. $$$ over lives is donnie's motto! # trumpIsTrash Thank you @ USNavy for stepping up as always!
Great job! Focus on COVID-19 (XI-virus) and you'll win in November. If the stock market will go down 30% or more, the stocks will be great again and attractive to real investors, not to speculators... so focus on this and the stock market will take care of itself.
Right on! The fact that THIS TIME trump cannot control the news cycles, the rising # of cases and deaths, or manipulate the stock market, unhinges his narcissism more. So he acts out to gain that center spotlight he so desperately craves, without regard for anyone. # AllAboutMe

Probably with all the people dying on social security. Trump and bush seem to think it's a piggy bank to raid when they need to fund boogas wars and bail out stock markets. Yet being president they get paid well after death.
When are we going to talk about the real reason the stock market crashed?
He is denying relief efforts, knew the virus was coming and claimed it fake, removed oversight to make a slush fund. He says people should die for the stock market. His only cares are for himself and money. He is a liar and a con and needs to resign. Educate yourself.

Mr. Trump doesn't want to see those numbers. He doesn't want the numbers to go up. When those numbers go up the stock market numbers go down. This is another reason testing has not been widely available in our country.

@ realDonaldTrump @ VP Please do consider very strongly shutting down travel into or out of NY NJ and Conn with some leeway for business it is totally unfair that people run from these states infecting people in states with few infections ready to resume their lives
Look how many people die in alcohol related deaths.Alchohol is an essential business?Shutting down businesses doesn't seem to make a lot of sense in the grand scheme of things.Somemaybe. But to the extent of bringing a country to ruin?I don't think so.Something else going on.
But I mean the way this virus has been multiplying, it's gonna surpass that 60 mill mark before half a year is done. Again I completely agree that the panic buying and general panacking is dumb. But I think the alertness of shutting non essential business down was a good idea.

Shut down the subway and have medical professionals use school buses to get to work. Business are taking a hit and at this point shutting down for another few days will at least contain the virus. God bless America . We will rebuild. We will overcome this. We will WIN!

One can understand that the World Health Organization is not a sovereign State and is not in the business of conducting international diplomatic games through long-distance interviews. But there are other ways of expressing that besides suddenly shutting down a conversation.
Everyone got money. Big companies, small companies, the people, everyone. Also it wasn't a bailout as much as it was compensation for shutting their business down.
ill be shutting down my business after this as government dont treat self employed same as other people so nows the time to close.All the Best Neal
If YOU HAVE BEEN IN NYC, you would also know that Feb. is by far the worse business month. Shutting down NYC in Feb. when businesses already laid off thousands, would of been the perfect & smart time to quarantine & implement a shut down of NYC.

providers will also lead to a higher fatality rate. The purpose of social distancing and shutting down non-essential travel and business is to prevent these scenarios from coming to pass. An once of prevention is worth a pound of cure. 3/x
Hello- they did and it was resolved quickly. I was grateful. wouldn’t have escalated it so publicly if it was big the day everything started shutting down for my business because of COVID-19. Did they ask you to DM them?

Repatriation flights. Positioning for storage. Some other airlines shutting down slightly later than others. Cargo, freight, mail, newspaper, military and some business flights including offshore oil and gas, etc. Some passenger aircraft now operating cargo only.
How do we ensure no mass layoffs or shutting down of SME business? Government intervention. I think we need another package for that.

Hmm, well, if China had done the needful by shutting out Shenzhen, then, Spain would not have fallen victim. Shenzhen's operation shows China's approval of their fakeries! China is synonymous with Piracy. Na so so fake fake things, spoiling business for genuine ones.
I want to find something to do while this is going on as my business has been completely destroyed with theatres shutting. Have no idea what though, I don’t think I’m qualified to do anything useful.
Government shutting down your business, offering your business a loan that will be forgiven if you spend the money the way the government tells you is how the government slowly takes control thru the backdoor. Ppl walk right into giving up their liberties. We get Gov we deserve

No, it was shutting down a non essential business.

This is just crazy. This is one more reason why the order for shutting down business should come from Washington.
Shutting down business (economy) is much worse. The solution can’t be worse than the cause.
I believe you come from money or privilege, no? Have you ever considered that shutting things down is going to be financial suicide for small business owners and their employees? Do you realize that people are leaving Cali in droves? Why is that?
You don’t stop blaming others and you certainly take every chance to be a Caty woman and whiner. Not only that you’ve hurt all of us residents with higher taxes, threats of shutting down the state to get the higher gas taxes and threatened to raise business taxes. # Whinerwhitmer

The Canadian government allowed people flying home to go about their business, that's what allowed it to get out of hand. Shutting down the country has devastating consequences. This should be obvious.
Why is the government shutting down private business? Why is a store like Hobby Lobby essential? Why is the death count so low? Why is the media sensationalizing every story? How can a state with 5million shut down, 170 cases ? 1 death.. why? The flu has killed over 1k in Al?Why

I'm certainly not but clothing stores are still allowed to operate. Most are now shutting because of a lack of business rather than any clear government directive.

You obviously have no clue what was actually said. Trump NEVER said to not take a call. And he said Pence is MAKING the calls against Trump's feelings. But Trump isn't prohibiting Pence or shutting off anyone. Quit being a slave to the media.
It doesn’t look like he’s shutting on the restaurant looks like he just layed off employees to cut his loses because restaurant business isnt going to be the same for months. I don’t agree with him blaming capitalism but my OG tweet never even said anything about that.
Took out the trash that was there before. Shutting down deep business
Aye ,and by that time we'll know that shutting down the country, trashing the economy ,causing mass business failures and years of new austerity was unnecessary
If I were Abe, I would have marched up there tonight and said, “we are shutting it all down for a month and here is the economic package that will ensure that every business and family gets through it intact.”
So the government shuts down the economy and its somehow the corperations fault that they are going out of business? Bailouts are retarded, but this isnt a bailout due to a companies incompetence, but rather the government shutting the economy down

Is staying home, shutting down all business activities, stopping the poor from going out to hustle for what to take into their belly a wiser way to end or limit the spread of # COVID19? My thought is with people that have nothing to eat for lunch and dinner.
Struggling to pay my bills. My small business is shutting down. Anything helps
Shutting down this spaza will make the citizens travel long distance to buy food .. so don’t think you are hurting the immigrant business you are just hurting your own people

Prime Minister Abe public address seems more concerned about the economy than anything else. I don't think he understands long term effects of not shutting down non-essential business and boosting the health care infrastructure because in the short term the GDP will take a dive.
So... They learned nothing from 9/11 shutting them down for quite some time? Got nothing? Not one lesson? Got it.
I don’t support it, but I will take the money as the government has hurt my business a great deal by shutting it down. I would lay everyone off without it. I think the old and vulnerable should all stay in, and people should stay away from them.

No the unemployment is due to shutting down non essential business.Govt is giving cash handout to affected workers.
The reaction is completely understandable, business owners are shutting down their livelihoods to help do their part, and then those idiots go out and do that. They should have been fined.

@ repmarkpocan unfortunately our govenor let business decide who's essential & of course the company I work for is definitely $ over ppl. Instead of just shutting down for a couple weeks now & make it up over the year. So short sided
No you are not. You're claiming Joann stores are "essential business" and keeping them open in counties w confirmed cases. Our county businesses are all voluntarily shutting, our schools, DMV. TJMAXX, Kohls, all shut down. YOU ARE ENDAGERING EVERYONE, and not letting workers off!
It just doesn’t make any sense that shutting down for 90 days, which is about 2.5% as long as our economy has been on fire for, is what shuts down a business, especially during a time where companies are significantly reducing overhead.
Thinking about small business owners and seeing some facing permanently shutting down from this got me thinking. We are coming out the absolute greatest and longest meteoric rise of an economy we have ever seen in our lifetimes. Cont.
Funny. Give us one so-called 'success'. I keep hearing this, and all I see are lots of missteps and failures. The only thing on time was shutting down flights from China, but his tax breaks flopped, he failed to bring much business back from China, he had to bail out farmers.
Small business in Aus are able to get assistance from the government. Although a lot are just shutting up shop until it ends. A lot of restaurants and cafes are doing take away and home delivery. My F45 are doing at home classes

Are you more worried about contracting COVID (or a loved one), or what the government shutting down private business/commerce will do to the economy and the future of our country for years to come? # coronavirus
No business as usual. Premier is shutting it all down. Interstate travel shut down as well.
But not afraid of starving? But then, if the business has simple transferred from supermarkets to farmer's market, then maybe they're not really in danger of starving. But, in that case, what is the good in shutting down the supermarkets and convenience stores?
Some people have to report to work even if they would rather stay home. Their boss is making them go in, they risk being fired if they don't go in. Shutting it down would mean that the business had to close its doors by governor order.
You mean the economy that was tanked by State governors literally shutting down business? Yah, Trumps fault on that. Prior to that it was the greatest ever for all Americans. Sad that you seem to relish in the fact that it was tanked in a matter of 2 weeks.
Here's the thing: It's not plausible. The Coronavirus is currently a disaster, that much is true, but it's not shutting us down for years. If it somehow did, we would have lost every small business in America first, and we'd probably no longer be a country.

Mississippi has a lower per capita gdp than 5 states in Mexico

I don't think it's talking in circles, I think you're just putting more emphasis on the percentage than I think it merits. The $1000 is a joke because it's impact is negligible. Its percentage of the US GDP is relatively significant. The opposite is true of the 25M.
A limited state is cheap enough that voluntary donations are sufficient. I'm guessing no more than 2% of GDP. Maybe less given that economic growth should explode under real capitalism. And yes, there will be a few free riders, but most people will want to contribute.

Yeah our economy wasn’t that strong 3-4% unemployment, 60000 per capita income; 21.7 trillion in gdp without being a huge exporter of oil (like Norway or russia).

Sad to say, but Spanish flu killed mostly young people while Covid kills mostly people out of the labour force. I suspect a little more work is needed before you are able to conclude that shutdowns are good for the economy (GDP wise).

According to some renowned financial people, the Fed will issue bonds and pay interest into. This is about 9% of our GDP and is manageable. This addition our national debt will 25 trillions. Not doing this will be more catastrophic.

Also, if wealth is finite, there would be the same amount of wealth as there was 100 years ago, the same gdp. And we both know that’s not the case.

Financial mobility, highest GDP on the planet, you get what YOU earn not what others are forced to give you
"In 2017, the United States spent about $3.5 trillion, or 18 percent of GDP, on health expenditures" (CRFB) Are you seriously saying that of the 18% of the GDP that goes toward healthcare, only 2% goes toward healthcare? That is a wacky number and shows we REALLY need Med4All!
Need a primer on how to read the economic statistics. Which unemployment rate to use? Will GDP exaggerate the decline in production as food, entertainment (board games, music), mended & stitched cloths, home improvements and landscaping are done at home outside the cash economy?

You would be a prime candidate to die for the economy. Can we count you in? I'll cover the cost of your cardboard box. Thank you for your dedication to America's GDP.
All things that could be achieved with Medicare Option for all, without cascading unemployment so you can get back at Corporate America. How many jobs will be lost, when you eliminate 16% of GDP? The @ GOP will LOVE repealing that when @ DNC loses the next election cycle.
It should not be a choice whether or not someone should have healthcare. Anything less than single payer is not enough. I'd like to ask, if Obama couldn't even achieve a public option, why do you think Biden can? Private health insurance doesn't make up 16% of the GDP, lol
121,000 cases , 2100 dead, economic recession . GDP down 20%. All you offer is spin . You will be all fired in 9 months .
Fine. We’ll become part of Canada and take our economies, natural resources, and ports with us. NY - 8% of US GDP.
I believe individuals should make that choice. Let Congress pass the Medicare Option for ALL, & lets see what happens. Erasing 16% of GDP, by forcibly eliminating private insurance will be disastrous. The unemployment surge will flip D.C., & ensure a repeal when @ GOP recovers.

Not according to international. Comparisons, WHO had it at 18th. Totally underfunded. Blair and Brown invested to raise % of GDP spent on health. The Tories reversed it, trashing NHS & social care/security funding.
If some European countries refuses to help to avoid the economic collapse of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th EU country for GDP due of a killer virus that is killing thousands of people destroying the economy... it is meaningless. There is no Union. EU is not only for saving German banks.
there is no such thing as "looting taxpayers" it's OUR money because we're a republic it's NOT "our money" because people create it OUR govt creates it OUR job is to spend it on GDP stuff & debts & rent & food taxes DESTROYS $$ created by deficit spend Trump is correct.

Alberta's GDP was $335 Billion and if we tax it at 25% that is $8 billion $375 million dollars every year to America's banks, but I propose giving America Quebec's share of Alberta forced equalization to Quebec every year until its paid which is $20 Billion at 71/2 years.

It’s not unfair as it works towards a fair economy. The rich could pay tax and afford necessaries while the poor can’t even do that. By lowering the burden of tax on working class this help lessen the gap and create a balanced GDP

The Government needs devise a long term plan for the economy in regards to absorbing the shocks caused due to COVID 19. The annual estimate growth for GDP for FY 2019-20 was predicted at 5% by NSO but this seems at risk as well since there is global recession prevailing.

Leaders of every stripe [+all law professors everywhere] should amplify ur tweet to prevent mass panic. +If # gop thinks # coronavirus will damage GDP they should think bout the damage anarchy will cause. https://twitter.com/tribelaw/status/1243971990521774080?s=21 …
Keynes died in 1946. What has planned obsolescence done to GDP since then? It creates unnecessary work & CO2. How many economists advocate mandatory accounting in the schools? If that had been done since Sputnik what would the economy be like today? 2003: https://www.upi.com/Accounting-collegians-vs-5th-graders/82121056408042/ …
Complete and utter bullshit. We still by far have the strongest economy, highest gdp, best infrastructure and work per man hour over any other country in the world. Stop this fear porn crap trying to generate traffic reviews. It's sickening.
So should WHO change their name to EVERYCOUNTRY IN THE WOLRLD BUT ENGLAND ORGANISATION. As we’ve obviously got this virus nailed. A quick check of European countries GDP states that Germany is the wealthiest and also has one of the best health care systems in the world!
Dice Eurostat: "in Germany and the Netherlands, workers work fewer hours than would be predicted on the basis of their levels of GDP per hour, which suggests a biased preference for leisure over income"
No dear , your GDP is going down rapidly , now it’s 5.2 but after this corona will be 4.5 ... Dear your ecconomny is running by Ambhani not govt .... so all benefits are going to ambhani family
The Fed now has a projection of a 50% gdp drop in Q2.
That's total $ amount of aid without regard to size of the country. Smaller countries give a far higher proportion of aid than the US. Based on GDP the US doesn't even make the top 10.
Please explain to me what GDP is ?
Now do your Karma cleaning. May be take all the Modi videos during Congress regime and keep posting everyday. That itself is enough to show what a situation we are in. Petrol, Dollar rupees, onion, inflation GDP, GST China, Pak, Kashmir all are in worst situation
NJ, CT, NY succeeding would have a GDP of India and a per cap of Switzerland... just saying.
This is new for me.. Germany was suffering a huge debt of 53Billion$,100% of its GDP, after 2nd W/War and # Pakistan was among those 21 countries who signed a accord in August1953 to half that debt,payable in next 30Years. Now PAK needs this favour. # CoronavirusInPakistan
GDP of india is 3260$ not 2500$ billion which may reduce not less than 2900$ at its worst GDP of Pakistan is 282 Billion not 300$ Billion i stated data not a tweet like an idiot does If u want to get further educated & embarassed i'll show u what ur state is regarding corona pic.twitter.com/HqA5M1aBlm
Virtually certain? You don't think that government spending in Q2 will see GDP in Q2 be a rise on Q1 GDP?
...almost every month, has insanely claimed that he's reduced the national debt, has falsely claimed that his GDP growth is nearly twice as high as it actually is, and has convinced the world that because the stock market has hit it's highest value during...
I believe US health "system" is particularly inefficient due to the prevalent litigation. IIRC, on aggregate a high % of GDP is spent on health insurance, but still a high % of the popn is not covered leading to poor stats eg infant mortality https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr63/nvsr63_05.pdf …
@ WHO How come Chinese are out of the danger though world’s positive cases are increasing? Why China took over entire stock and there GDP is increasing? https://twitter.com/Danielverma007/status/1244005851771236352 …
THIS IS HOW THEY DO IT. Danish gov't paying salaried workers 3 months salary (abt 13% GDP) so they don't lose their jobs during nat'l shutdown and can afford the basic necessities. Other countries study it now. # COVIDー19
How do you explain that the national dept not may exceed 60% of GDP (under European rules) and that Italy is way above that with 131%. Why do the Italians fail to reduce the national debt? Don’t they want to so? The Netherlands did when it was needed. https://www.europa-nu.nl/id/vkz9i527orzt/nieuws/italiaanse_partijen_willen_niet?ctx=vgaxlcr1jzjv&tab=0 …
How many White Claws would I have to drink to meet my daily recommended water intake? Would not be surprised if @ WhiteClaw is single handedly making up for the loss in # GDP this # pandemic
Not for his worth which is a result of government research thru universities. Tax the rich b/c Capitalism is a myth with $6T (30% of gdp) to prop up this so called Capitalist economy; it won’t be the last Eric: FED QE + / economic stimulus this year!
Now im such dilemma, I'll have a bias towards saving lives. Hence do whatever it takes. If to save millions must drag the GDP down, then be it.
Lol this anime kid thinks poor af refers to gdp in this context
@ airtelindia thank you for the horrible network you provide..I guess you will solely be responsible for India's GDP going down as people using your network will not be able to even work from home...
There is a modelling going at the moment that if the GDP falls by 6.4%, all the gov has done is wasted effort/money and should stop as this fall will reduce our life expectancy from average 81y.o to around 78, thus losing more lives that Coronavirus would. No peer review i think
if the President of the EU Commission imprudently speaks out against a request made by a group of countries that represent 60% of GDP, he must consequently resign and return to minister in Germany. # vonderLeyen
Justin taking credit for Canada’s balance sheet is infuriating. I thought Twitter was my outlet but I think I need a punching bag now. And it doesn’t include the provincial debt which in Ontario is 40% (++) of GDP. # onpoli # cdnpolipic.twitter.com/6rx6gs6fIl
People in France are shocked when I tell people Lombardy has a higher GDP/capita than France.
1) I’ve been a USA/China watcher since the 90s when their GDP put them at the 10th largest. It was the same thing back then with Americans. They can’t do this can’t do that. Which ends up turning out bad for America. So yes you don’t believe what they say right now.
# GOP standing while @ potus sayin he can quarantine political rivals [those not out there saying Granny should # DieForTheDow] If these MF not careful a recession gonna be the least of their worries ...mass panic causes far more damage to GDP. :|
She's a great senator and a wonderful person.
Because these uneducated dumbtards enjoy to play around figures INDIA'S GDP IS $2940 BILLION DOLLARS NOT $2500 B
U.S. was bankrupt with debt at 107% of GDP before # COVID19. It did not matter what they did or did not do. The GCR event on our timeline is moving closer.https://twitter.com/RoryTDC/status/1244002899648274432 …
8 of the top 10 states with the highest GDP’s are blue states & I live the the healthiest state (CO) but we give much of our surplus tax revenue (and pay high insurance premiums) bc states like Alabama can’t stop shoveling candy, soda and Doritos into their stupid obese faces.
Everyone predicts a tremendous drop in GDP. And that makes sense, restaurants, hotels, closed, flights mostly cancelled. But among the people I know, the opposite is true. People are locked up with nothing to do, so they work day, night, weekends...
Pakistan spends roughly 0.2 percent of the GDP on higher education and yet political circles expect miracles from the academic research & development community. It's high time to learn from the situation and set our priorities right.
Population of England: 55 million. Taxes: 33% of GDP Population of Denmark: 6 million. Taxes: 46% of GDP Population of Canada: 37 million. Taxes: 33% of GDP Population of USA: 340 million. Taxes 26% of GDP https://twitter.com/nsouthern95/status/1243997210129268741 …
they pay 4B€ (net) in the EU budget (0.4% of gdp) ,get about 97B€ from free trade with the EU,but if you ask them,''we pay you way too much''. here in greece,we have 17% unempl., mean salary700€,wages falling,deindustrialized,we neverthought it is the fault of the EU..
Typically fast growth for US GDP is like 2.5 to 3.5% —- this will be 2x AND if this last 3 months that would surprise ... most folks let go will be on unemployment for this time AND saving a ton while quarantined - Cant agree with your call MORE! Gas at lows, mortgage at lows.
I bow to you on all matters SEC, any American history especially as regards B Franklin, but the Irish backed out in 1921 from the other guys so now speak to you as equals, apart from GDP and loads of other stuff. Respect to your views on Lincoln and automakers..some folks know 0.
