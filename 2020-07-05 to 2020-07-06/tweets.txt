The closest economic multiplier for the Pandemic UI is probably the food stamps expansion (1.73) -- but given the situation, it could be higher. Ending it would likely remove upwards of $65B per month in economic activity from the US economy (assuming 1.73 multiplier)

The economy was shutting down either way. Do you honestly believe that people wouldn't have changed their behavior if deaths kept piling up? Shutting down earlier and more drastically would have saved more lives and jobs.
Do you think these houses are all owned by the government? Fool, the Chinese economy is actually capitalism. The Communist Party changed its name and said it was socialism with Chinese characteristics. We have a property law. Houses are private property and are protected by law.
Communism in theory is entirely different than Communism in practice. Communism is slavery. Capitalism has nothing to do with slavery. Capitalism has lifted more people out of poverty than any other economy system, anywhere ever throughout history.
Additionally, the success of European leagues rests on the level of control in their home markets, not some absurd bubble. This isn’t society as a whole. MLS is not vital to the economy & players shouldn’t be forced to be exposed. It’s a totally different situation than UEFA.
All I near is can’t let your opposition vote. Since you don’t care about older people (your supporters) and are willing to let them die to save the economy, you and your party will go down in flames come November. You have single handedly destroyed the Republican Party.

The third package/deal would sell to China what demand is low in Italian economy, what goods are not selling due to recovery issues, have those goods be sold to China. Then move to trade deals with EU after these three measures.

It is a bit of a joke really, insofar as for some of the mid-twentieth century, Brazil was considered to be "the country of the future", as the economy developed. Brazil is like the US, with a mix of Europeans, Africans, and Native Americans, but has no color lines per se.

At first Sweden's export-heavy economy seemed to be doing okay, with GDP actually growing by 0.1 per cent in the first quarter. But now the country is expected to follow the same path as most of Europe, with its economy shrinking for the full-year 2020 and unemployment soaring.

You want to talk economy? The longer you behave like this, the longer your economic environment is going to dampen. Just get it over with. Wear mask, social distancing, practice good hygiene, stay at home unless necessary. It isn't hard.
The Economy is often just shorthand for GDP which is why Govt doesn’t care what they spend money on as long as lots of dollars are going out into the ether and being counted as economic growth.

We use money to public labor to get together with natural resources and produce real stuff. The point about understanding how our monetary system works is precisely so we can focus on the real economy. Money is no object.

As I understand MMT, the circular nature of the concept is likely the cause of this. Recognizing the economy starts with (and should be dictated by) production avoids this recursion. It helps that foundational texts start from this recognition as well.

Yes, “the economy” has devolved into so esoteric religious term, only understood by the selected adepts. The fact is that they literally make it up as they go to serve their current purpose.

The right wing is trying to shift the focus from Republican failures in the economy, pandemic, and foreign policy to statues and culture wars. The truth is, our country needs greater investment in health care, a stronger safety net, and a foreign policy not controlled by Putin.
The foreign labor is one inevitable, it's part our globalised economy But I guess that this is the closest we will come to agreeing with each other
What’s great is how the economy was great, the US leading on everything. There was more pride in our country, more pride in her people. Nothing is ever perfect
Well for starters he rescued the economy, you’re too ignorant to understand that and probably give all the credit to trump, but if you objectively look at the data it’s clear as day.
im not looking at one part, im looking at the entire thing yes, trump may have improved the economy and brought jobs to the US, but when it comes down to dealing with social problems (ex. Social Injustice) he winds up gaslighting the issue and making it far worse
@ TeamPelosi We do have an Anarchist in our midst. It is Trump! His intentions are to do nothing to improve the crisis now facing us.Let the Covid increase,overrun hospitals&crash our economy. Avoid solving issues of policing. Keep us divided so we become combatants.Create chaos!
The entire infrastructure of this country is built on the backs of slaves from the economy to the design and building of the White House. Without slavery your folks would still be in Europe.
Really? Have you not seen the reports on the number of child sex trafficking rings Trump has found and charged? Or how their economy (before covid) was the strongest it's been in years? Oh wait, mainstream media don't report that because they are a Democrat propaganda tool.
His Tariffs destroyed the economy, not the virus. The pandemic did not help but it was already headed to a recession. Manufacturing jobs lost as well as farming jobs
honestly in this economy,,,, yes
Murphy Shoulda never sit Woodrow Wilson's desk Wilson was a reformer who not only fought a Great Plague without destroying the economy but also won a World War and establish the foundations of what would become the United Nations Murphy it's just a political hack
Medicine and hospitals don’t go away in a single payer system, CEOs, advertising, beurocracy and legal do. This is evident because other countries exist without the private health system and have similar or better unemployment numbers.
Joe Biden is the one who said if you don’t vote a certain way, you ain’t black. Trump repelled the Crime Bill which targeted black people. Joe Biden hasn’t done a damn thing for equality. Lowest unemployment for black people and women under Trump. Doesn’t fit your agenda though
Lowest black unemployment rate ever under his economy. There is no proof Trump is racist because he isn't, just stop. Turn off CNN.

I’m a massage therapist. I’ve been called back to work. I absolutely do not feel safe with numbers rising and especially the number of active cases quarantined. You know they aren’t staying home! If I don’t go back to my job I lose unemployment.
I think the issue many people have during the pandemic is that people on unemployment are currently getting more money than a lot of essential workers. Obviously there are a lot of factors that play into that, but many working ppl feel slighted bc they could make more $ w/o work

And if that was true, and we know that you make baseless claim, those deaths will be due to not getting timely healthcare, not attributable to unemployment. It is important to understand the data, causation and correlation.

The real damage may not show until September, because expanded unemployment extends past calculation for July, to be reported Aug 7th So there's likely to be steep losses in Aug, to be reported Sep 4th, something . @ realDonaldTrump cannot possibly recover from by the election
Or you could mind the business that pays you and not concern yourself with the finances of others. If they want to say they’re broke, which is a figure of speech, even though they’ve been getting unemployment, they have that right.
So in US just to mention they are into unemployment relief funds , don't laugh. Saw somewhere.

Okay let’s get this straight. The only reason unemployment was as low as it was was because the policies that Obama had put in place. And black unemployment has been decreasing since Obama took office.Since Trump has taken office it’s only gone down 2%
Agreed and he continually says we can't continue the cares act unemployment help because people just want to sit home and be lazy like you have any choice! No idea how it works but there is making decisions about it!

Look at it from my point of view. The black unemployment rate is only slightly higher from when he took over from Obama. The country was coming out of a recession. Second what good is a change of employment if the countries mindset is still overlooking you because of your race.
You’re right Obama in his 8 year term did the following- funded HBC, prison reform and historic low minority unemployment. Oh crap I was wrong again. It was Trump that did all that.

Morrison Liberals still crying over by-election NSW when unemployment numbers growing by 2022 so marketing Morrison will be talking negative words on Labor with old Murdoch
I'm confused, is trump having te lowest unemployment rate and the lowest poverty rate among blacks not in the slightest bit helping?
Did your research? Ok Explain how Biden saying he will raise taxes is better for the economy. Explain how is foreign policy will be better for the country. How will he get the unemployment numbers better to where they were pre-pandemic? How about the GDP?
That means: Passing the Paycheck Security Act. Passing the Emergency Health Care Guarantee Act Providing $2,000 emergency payments to every working class American until this crisis is over. Saving the Postal Service Extending the $600 a week increase in unemployment benefits
New jobs setting records but why did my state ask for 1 billion dollars from the government to be able to pay the people that filed for unemployment
Many forecasts have unemployment at 10% through 2021!
President Trump you’re a fucking disgrace so worried about yourself and trying to get reelected why are you screwing everybody out of their unemployment they’ve earned I have no respect for you at all anymore and you floss my vote
Mr President,We need the 2nd Stimulus Check NOW & an extension on the unemployment ($600plus the original unemployment).We the AMERICAN (LEGAL)PEOPLE need your HELP.What do you think of: $2.5k per adult/$5k for couples and $1.2k per child? CHRISTmas is coming people will spend
Highest stock market means nothing to an economy in the toilet. Highest unemployment since the Great Depression 30 million unemployed.Donates 400 thou while grifting millions from American coffers. The rest is laughable .

on second thought, you are correct. Trump was able to decrease minority unemployment rate and created millions of jobs for minorities, But who cares about that. Let’s get trump out of office. because democrats truly care about blacks lives and not just black votes

Lol the irony of “what works” when the official unemployment rate is literally 11% right now.
The claim I made is that the unemployment created by the lockdown kills. This has been well studied. You have sent nothing that supports a lower mortality with higher unemployment.
This is essential! Canada paid $2000 per month for 6 months for anyone who didn't qualify for Unemployment benefits. USA needs to do the same.
I believe it’s just regular unemployment. They havent extended the additional $600 we been getting
Also I know that the extra unemployment money is ending this July in the states so that may be impacting purchasing. I reached out to an amazing OG sub the other day who is also just dealing with the state of the world energetically rn. It’s so much

Won’t last. Covid unusual situation. And unemployment already going back down. More jobs back than expected.
This is just classic short term thinking. People who got laid off also got unemployment. It wasn't the workers trying to get back to die at their shitty jobs, it was business owners speaking for them because they were losing their shirts.
Even if cases were up from testing (they're not), how would cases go up from testing if you're slowing down testing?? What upside down BS is this? And record jobs numbers? We're still at 12% unemployment!
And while we’re at it let’s see Hillary Clinton’s emails, oh and also, would love to know what president has the strongest US economy and lowest unemployment rate in US history

Unbelievable. Lowest black unemployment rate ever with Trump. Dont even know where your getting these stats, unless it's the MSM and they are not trust worthy in any reportings.
They do. Believe me, they have a whole Herd of rabbits. If, coup's, impeachment, rioting, 130K virus deaths, shutdown and massive 40M unemployment, 6 trillion in new debt, and a domestic terrorist plot to destroy our culture, society and history hasn't worked, Nothing is too far.
the unemployment benefit? I think Jersey is
Please stop wasting money on celebrating. 130k American have died because of your family. Dump Trump!!! Worthless family. Massive Unemployment, massive race issues across the USA. Do something and stop sending out these worthless tweets. Do something. USA is suffering.
@ cher so if that were true, why would he empower blacks? Before the global pandemic, blacks had lowest unemployment and highest home ownership EVER! For about 3 years. That didn’t happen during 8 years of Obama.
What if I told you many of these people blew their stimulus and unemployment dollars up their nose and shot them into their arms?
If you close businesses then you need to do the steps to insure people will receive their unemployment. Blaming the previous administration, who didn’t need a large unemployment angency, doesn’t help those that need help
trump denied the pandemic. trump has continued to do nothing. 130k deaths. Unemployment is thru the roof. And yes, we happen to be in the middle of a pandemic. But every bit of it happened on trump's watch. Thems the facts.
Y’all are really out here hating on people that’s on unemployment. They do not have a job and you do .... count your blessings.

Uh, Donald trump did prison reform And gave the black people the lowest unemployment and highest wage growth in history.
People will further lose their businesses, one more rule for bringing more unemployment. Great idea.
I agree the unemployment rate has been a trend over the years but I think he can be credited with helping continue the trend with his tax cuts. And I’m open to finding ways to help black people become successful but I don’t think the help should come completely from the governmen
Worker's right to own. It lets groups of people on unemployment pool 2 years worth of benefits to buy a businesses while the state lends the rest at low interest.
@ truehotelguru says ppl can survive on regular unemployment (wrong, Bob) and the life saving benefits cause ppl to not want to work. bro the hospitality industry is dead rn (as it should be in a pandemic). Get over it. Fuck ur economy, Bob, care about human lives, not money.

Done enough damage? Like what? Giving black people the best unemployment numbers they have ever had in the history of this country? Undoing Crime Bill? Creating opportunity zones? You kidding me? lol. Trump has done more for the black community if 4 years than Dems in 4 decades.
The tough part is I felt like our country united for like 2 months (trying to survive and figure out unemployment, etc) and then all of a sudden it was HELLA politicized and all our friends stopped giving F’s... it’s getting hard these days
I’ve got someone telling me that trump has helped the black community with the lowest unemployment, families coming off welfare and prison reform. Thoughts?
Black unemployment did hit a low, Horner economists view this growth from Obama’a presidency and that doesn’t take away from the fact that the racial wealth gap is worsening.
Isn’t that the truth!

You have the highest unemployment numbers since the great depression. Want to get people back to work? Masks, a real quarantine and maybe we can have a fall this year. Your games and ego have cost us the summer already, not to mention the thousands of lives you lost.
Yeah an 11% unemployment rate ( and it is probably worse than that) is really something to crow about. It is “setting records” Your testing is still inadequate and does not account for increased positivity rates and increased hospitalization rates. Covid is out of control
As the EPI article explains, lower unemployment among black Americans did not reduce the racial income gap. That disparity grew. Compared to white Americans, black Americans saw their incomes fall after Trump took office.
Being on unemployment means you lost your job outside of your own volition for example A PANDEMIC HITTING THE GLOBE AND SHUTTING EVERYTHING DOWN for you to scrunch your ugly face at someone on it shows you are a terrible person. Capitalism clearly is a disease.

In 4 weeks 20% of the US economy is going to hit a brick wall when their expanded unemployment stops. I feel like we're not talking enough about that and how awful it's going to be.
The crazy part is I wasn’t talking about the fact that you swear. I was talking about you calling people “bum ass mfers” for seemingly being on unemployment.
Wrong!!! Look at the numbers of unemployment from places having to shut down. Cases are steadily rising and hospitals are filling up because everyone listened to you when it was said that it was fine. Now we are having record cases in hospitals and each day, and job losses also
Record HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT
The facts are trump has the lowest black unemployment in the history of America and that’s a fact. Do some research and stop being a sheep.. Obama was in office 8 years and didn’t do sh*t .. Also don’t forget about prison reform. What did the great Obama do?? Nothing
Um lowest black unemployment, opportunity, prison reform, $ for black colleges, banned choke holds....how did this not happen under Obama, bidens 44 years....c'mon get serious
Yeah reaping the 20% unemployment and million covid cases while 90 million have no insurance and those that do still likely risk bankrupty. Mmmhm breathe in that sweet sweet free market. You petulant arrogant child people are dying and going homeless in America over stupid greed
130,000 dead and counting. Depression era unemployment. Sit down.
No, your argument is completely invalid because the vast majority are making more on unemployment than they did working. That's a fact.
Black unemployment under President Trump decreased in record numbers. That’s showing love that Obama was incapable of showing.

Hospital rates and deaths are up, mostly in RED STATES. Who didn't do the right things in the beginning. Jobs. These are people going back to work, not new people added to the workforce. 42 million on unemployment, 7.5 million go back the past two months.

After covid, and these outrageous unemployment rates, hopefully people will understand why people can't always "pick themselves up by their bootstraps and just get a job"
The unemployment rate is sitting at a 75 year high ... is that what you mean by getting people off of assistance? Or maybe it’s the 130,000 dead that does that for you?
Jealous of people on unemployment but I bet y’all wont quit your jobs. Just say you wish you had better pay. That’s understandable.
So you think you & your loved ones are immune to Covid, wave off predictions that current unemployment levels are with us till 2030, and don't give a damn that he failed to act when told Russia had bounties on our soldiers. You're not brainwashed. You're simply a selfish wench.

What specific steps does Joe advocate for to eliminate the virus and end unemployment?
please enlighten me why Trump is the worst president in history. Record low unemployment rates, following through with his campaign promise to protect our southern border. Illigal immigration has decreased to almost nothing.
The African American comminity than ANY President has ever done since Lincoln. Including, releading thoysands if African-Americans locked uo by Biden & the Clintons. Funding HBCU's and record black unemployment. Trump will never be the enemy its the Democrats who r selling
Easy to set records on employment when you have unemployment at levels not seen since the Great Depression. Not sure why media should report happily on >11% unemployment, which is a flat out disgrace. Just look at your own tweets before you became president.
GOP love is killing America. • >132,000 dead • >22M jobs lost, 2.9M gone forever • >11% unemployment • deficit exploded from $585B to $3.7T • -40% to -50% est Q2 GDP • >19,000 lies • >15 conspiracy theories • 1 Russian Bounty program • 0 PDBs read 120 days to # Vote2020

Facts blowing they unemployment checks running the numbers up
Are you really so absurd to try and blame Trump for unemployment? Prior to outbreak unemployment was remarkable! Hardly think he created the virus! Governors are the politicians deciding to shut our economy down. Trump is responsible for a lot but your argument is moronic!
You are intellectually dishonest! When he took it: 800,000 job losta month, auto crashed 401K zero, losing 22 banks a day. Market frozen at 6000. Unemployment 12% When he left: unemployment 4.2, 14 million jobs created, market at 20000, auto 1 in the world, 401k up 21% per crash
wayv are not going anywhere under that company not having their main market behind them doesn’t help either it’s going to be the same cycle of unemployment & two weeks of promo until their contract is up and then they’ll all get snatched up by different c-ent companies lol
Hi, so this is random but if I started an informative blog/YouTube channel on navigating the “poverty” of living paycheck to paycheck, with tips ranging from scoring cheap furniture, making healthy meals for less, navigating unemployment, etc etc, would anyone be into that?
Instead of a Garden of Heroes how about Coronavirus Relief! How about affordable healthcare! How about lowest unemployment rates in history, and don’t count jobs reopening from the quuarantine. How about accountability for treasonous acts! How about true LEADERSHIP!
Unemployment I would assume, especially the boosted unemployment benefits under CARES.
How is the new job numbers setting records? The unemployment rate is still the highest ever, so when we get these jobs coming back, it doesn’t mean shit. # ThePresidentIsStupid
Symbols of hate and oppression are always better destroyed. Hitler and Saddam H. Weren't honored to preserve history just as the Berlin wall had to come down. Trump should worry more about the deficit. Unemployment and thousands dead from a pandemic he now pretends never happened

New job numbers that are setting records? How about 10% unemployment? That record hasn’t been seen since the Great Recession or the Great Depression before that.

Actually, Obama had record unemployment. There were many not included in those stats because they had given up looking. The better number is employment. That reached an all-time high. In addition, the amount of people on government assistance dropped quite a bit under Trump.
Tories have made the situation worse by raising the retirement age. If they had any sense (if) they would say anyone over 55/60 could take early retirement which would alleviate the unemployment problem. And before anyone asks, no I've already retired.
Doesn't matter much to me. See you in September when 300,000 dead from COVID in States, and unemployment hits 15%. Thank goodness, it's not Trump's fault.

before COVID-19 Trump only helped blacks, Hispanics and Asians achieve the lowest unemployment rate in history!
Plus unemployment comes out of that person’s future social security. It’s literally their money
Trump gave us the lowest black unemployment rate pre-corona. No president could have avoided the economic issues corona brought on
I dont call him out for the unemployment numbers because I avoid double standards, I know a pandemic popping up is out of his hands but I think people make fun of him because he said he was going to make an already growing rapidly economy “great again” and now we are here.

Hahahaha. Remember when this was about “flattening the curve” and making sure our healthcare systems don’t get overwhelmed? Well, they never were and they aren’t now. Instead we have 25% unemployment and border on civil war. Godspeed when you realize you are only a pawn.
Hey, Ted - maybe push your buddies Mitch and POTUS to help Gov. Abbott with the completely out of control pandemic in your own state. We could use doctors, nurses, PPE, tests, an expansion of unemployment benefits, and contact tracing

The unemployment line has got rough. I take it they had their foodstamps cut. # Trump2020
Your unemployment numbers are STILL higher than Obama’s when he took office, So WHAT are you talking about? DEATHS are NOT down, they are STILL going UP now at over 132,000 Americans dead in 4 mos. Low and steady?! WTH does that mean? How is steady EVER a good thing re DEATH? https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1279906540791779334 …
We can we prove it. We can prove coordination. We can prove deliberate action to inc death count to justify vote-by-mail, stay-at-home, bail-out-state, kill-economy, kill-P-rallies, inc unemployment, etc.
Record UNEMPLOYMENT, idiot.

4 people dead from ebola and Obama isn't doing enough, being wildly irresponsible by not stepping up protections. 132,000 DEAD AND THE GOP SAYS NOTHING? Not a peep. No demands of guidelines, funds for smalls businesses, unemployment help, schools? No, just DEAL WITH IT?

The #of jobs recovered is absolutely astonishing. To be at 11% unemployment at this point is truly remarkable and an indication that the fundamentals of our economy are strong. No one would have predicted this after we effectively shut down our economy!

Higher than it was when it was at all time record lows. Including the current unemployment brought on by the virus is not a fair scale. His policies were bring unemployment down until the virus hit.
Record new jobs after record loss of jobs. Actually 25million unemployment,actually 12%. You blew it. You should have listened to your team and flatten the curve, but noooo. Now it’s totally out of control. 99% harmless 130k dead. Do the math moron. Plus long term illness.
Apparently, he's planning to solve the unemployment issue through a national culling?
Many metrics are available to show this. The COVID-19 deaths and the unemployment rates are a good place to start.
They are people who went back to work except for the thousands who have been laid off and doesn’t have a job to go back to. Millions of people still trying to get unemployment benefits..
What is the unemployment rate , genius?
Millions of dollars spent while the virus numbers surge, millions without their jobs and loosing their unemployment benefits while the Congress takes a break and the president appeals to his base. Who approved this unnecessary expenditure
How can u say you have # recordhigh job numbers when we have had record high unemployment? When we get back to where we were then let’s start counting # growth
Some of this is likely to related to the insane levels of unemployment and financial distress. They usually go together

Trump had China warning.Italy warning.Spain warning.He just didn't care for any. Shutting down the economy was not in his agenda bc its awful for his hotel business. And his friends biz. So the USA got 130K deaths and counting. Take him to The Hague for crimes agaisnt Humanity.

Oh I definitely think it’s a nightmare. I also think Clay is using this situation for his political ambitions. I’m totally against shutting things down again because it will completely crash the economy. We can be cautious and still continue doing our day to day business.

A friend of mine told me a friend of theirs is shutting down their business for good in Mpls near Mpls Institute of Art. I think those lawyers who advertise to sue the Boy Scouts or Big Pharma should sue the Govt for destroying their businesses.

It’s a government run entity & I guess they’re demonstrating that they mean business by shutting everything down.
I completely understand that and we aren’t saying it’s not serious it’s just not serious enough for us to keep shutting down small business the heart of our country.
shutting the economy down perfect way to make millions of home and business owners go under. also the perfect chance to raise taxes because you know cutting back on spending is a big no no

Before the virus I was going to just ignore political shit. But then they started shutting down business. Including mine. That just put me on a different path.
Hoping this business, like other businesses, are able to endure. I applaud these folks for disclosing the public health concern even if it meant shutting their doors.
Finally, given their business practices we will more than likely be shutting down the CC Facebook & Instagram pages indefinitely. It’s not much, but it’s something small we can do on our side for now. We appreciate everyone’s understanding and can’t wait to finally be back.
That's your option, as may be the enforcement option of shutting down your place of business as is happening here. We all decide what's important to us, if wearing a mask is somehow so objectionable you can certainly forego your paycheck to make a point.
Reminder that every business that is shutting down could have been saved by Trump. Instead of helping small businesses, he gave friends amd donors huge bailouts.
That's why I be shutting the custom beats game down... Everyone does business differently but I feel that if artist's really fuck w/ anyone's beat style. They should hit the site.
Oh I think it was a huge mistake shutting down small businesses. You shut down small business then tell everyone to go to a superstore to get their stuff where masks are not mandatory.
Thank you greedy business manager for not shutting down factories even after 10 employees tested positive
How bout we just “normalize” minding your business and shutting the fuck up. . .
I own a business. I agree with shutting down again if numbers spike. No amount of money if worth making people sick.
Bars are shutting down due to bar owner negligence. So many places were breaking the rules and not protecting their customers! Another wave of bars going out of business is imminent, all because some idiots didn’t follow the rules. DAMN SHAME!!

It’s real but not worth shutting down the entire world. In America, no leader has the right to shut down a single business. They can ask us to shut down, they can recommend safety precautions, but that’s it. The constitution doesn’t give them full power during a virus.
U still dnt get it broer..Him leaving SA mean shutting down his business it's as simple as that otherwise if he leaves SA to Europe n his business still operates that will not affect the tax base of SA coz his business will still b paying tax
lol @"there's always risks" The government shutting you down for 6 months for absolutely no reason isn't really what you learn about in business school. In this current environment I don't know why anyone would bother.
And so # California, have you had enough nonsense from one party # DemocratSocialist rule? Are you ready to throw these greedy tyrants out of office? Remember, Newsom kept his business open, while shutting down yours. It'll only get worse if you don't vote them out.
Remember tho, it’s shutting normal, healthy, business as usual schools that hurts kids. We don’t know that masked, socially-distanced, stressful schools are equivalent.

Only if you are willing to lose a percentage of your income equal or greater to the percentage of revenue the business will be losing from shutting their doors, not cool that your asking business to give up money while you still cash your same check every week!
Trump, this time around, will have to intervene whether he wants to or not. Fail to do so THIS TIME they will lock America down far harder than back in the spring. NO business will be exempt from the local health dept. shutting them down for "non-compliance".
It is essentially equal to shutting down a milk business that is packing unhealthy milk or a pharmaceutical company that is producing illegal drugs. Nothing more to it.

I commented on my gym's post about shutting down, saying it's a shame that they didn't get enough help from the Gov to tide themselves over. Small business owner Karen decides to argue there is enough help cus she's gotten it. I'm sure you don't earn a gym though my dear
And as always it is the small guys that will take the max brunt of this. Can the corporation stand as a guarantor when small business want a bridging loan to inject liquidity ? If you absolutely feel that shutting down businesses for lockdodown is the only possible way ?
Lmao, at all the “drs” in the comment section. It’s unconstitutional, seriously, there can’t be that many dumbasses in this country. Shutting down this business, keeping this one open, saying it’s okay to riot/protest, but don’t you dare go to church, or to a Trump rally.
Shutting down again implies we’re open for business. Stop protecting your boy Murphy and start acting like journalists. Where’s the journalist investigations into @ GovMurphy nursing home policy that led to the states 50%+ death of this virus? While he was too busy raising $ 4 DGA

Shutting down their operation so his makes more money? Prudent business decision.
Great example of why shutting down a business like rafting companies does nothing but hurt local businesses. The crowd was no less and these companies and their employees could still make money. Shut any business and people will just gather elsewhere.

If your going off unemployment numbers during a pandemic from China shutting down every nonessential business to judge Trump's first term, that's outrageously ignorant and blinding to the improvement Trump did with the black workforce before China interfered

Absolutely. Small business owners are pissed. This won’t hurt big corporations. But shutting down the economy has seriously damaged the them.
This is a nonessential business that doesn’t need to open. It just risks more. With our numbers, we need to be shutting back down. Not opening.
Shutting down the people who support burning down innocent local business, looting, doxxing little kids, and lying about numbers to support their own agenda*
Seriously. The medical staff are quoted right here saying they are running out of beds. They are transferring people. Watching the trends they are shutting lots of business activity down. Just accept it. There's a real problem here.
It's so weird to watch everything reopen when conditions are objectively much worse than they were in March. Big business must really regret shutting down at all.
“Printed money” doesn’t actually goes into the real economy sufficiently to support all asset prices. Most of it reside on Central Bank’s balance sheet to prevent cascading dominos in the market. Unemployment and business shutting down are the real indicators to look for.

Justin Trudeau's numbers "oddly" missing. And, again, where's the GDP portions for all? After all, your hero Trudeau has been spent five years rationalizing his deficits on the basis of debt-to-GDP ratios not rising. If it's good enough for him, why isn't it for anybody else?

No. It doesn't require a "Fraser Institute study" to pull out GDP and debt-to-GDP numbers for each Prime Minister and debt-to-GDP ratios. It simply requires pulling data from Canada's annual Balance of Accounts. It really isn't difficult. Well, maybe for HDSers.
Exactly - with GDP growth and some inflation then prices will always rise slightly. Therefore people need more money to spend ... and because money in existence is part of the national debt it follows that cuts are the wrong medicine for growth.

You're right, Apple. When compared to GDP and average salary Jamaica's CoL is astronomically high. A good indicator of knowing when your economy is bad is when even the better jobs with the higher salaries are still comparatively low when measured against the Global North. 1/2
Canada's ODA spending amounts to approx. 0.27% of GDP, which is well below the UN benchmark of 0.7%. That's 27 cents out of every 100 dollars of wealth generated in Canada that goes to foreign aid spending. Hardly generous.
The Economy is often just shorthand for GDP which is why Govt doesn’t care what they spend money on as long as lots of dollars are going out into the ether and being counted as economic growth.

China's GDP is much higher than India's, isn't it? Our quality of life is better than that of Indians. I hope your government can give you such a "false" life.
There's also "facts" with "context". Besides not adding Trudeau Jr. to that chart (I'm sure that will *never* happen now), how about a chart showing GDP by Prime Minister. There's a reason why Harper left Canada with a lower debt-to-GDP ratio than when he started.
That being said tho I gotta say/ admit that Ontario's Wealth always struck me as "Attractive" mostly because the people that live there/ in it's Cities @least have "good morals" tho, after all their not Americans none of their Cities are an embarrassment to their GDP Numbers.

Oh, I understand economics. Look back to post war Britain. Debt was 150% of GDP. Yet Labour built the health service and brought the economy back. I’m afraid you’re describing is the ‘household’ explanation of economics. It’s far more complex, and most people don’t understand it.

An SU-30SMK probably costs more than Venezuela's GDP.
Finland, Sweden, Nethlamds all have higher percentage of people living below the poverty line, with a % of labor participation, and 15%-20% lower GDP per capita. Which, you guessed it, lower median income. Not to mention Findland is smaller than Nashville, TN.
Nope unless you'd rather the NHS suffered? The arts contribute 11 billion to the 2.5 trillion GDP. Hence why it's near bottom for funds. Other industries help the economy more. Might be people's livelihoods but unfortunately pandemics don't stop for that. Tough decisions

Goldman Sachs forecast for US GDP growth revised down Goldman Sachs economists revised down their projection for economic growth in the US, to a contraction of 4.6% this year (from previous projection at -4.2%). Socks forget the real economy!
Our GDP % relying on trade is more than theirs. Don't take my word for it, look up on the World bank's website. China is also the world's largest consumer market. Name me some other companies who have 5G apart from Nokia and Ericsson? Why is the US banning Huawei then?
From 2010 - 2020 the "% change" showed a % decrease of 74% You cannot say "rate of increase" with a variable that grows every year when it shows a % decrease - in any academic field GDP from 2.9% to 0.4% This would not be reported as a "rate of increase" in GDP pic.twitter.com/R89tSaNV9C
As i said, u do not have a complete picture, i do not dispute that that thier economy is 5 times our GDP, that is why they are such a nuisance today to the whole world. The so called liberals countries allowed china to become a frankestine monster even after rolling tanks in '89.

You are correct Michael, countries like that ones the Debt vs %GDP is higher than 200%
It's ridiculous. They just want help paying for their military. And the countries at the top (Japan, South Korea, Germany) have a higher GDP per capita than we do.
Are you joking? China's per capita GDP is x5 of ours and they produce more patents than The US. They are no longer the world's 'cheap manufacturing' hub. Why do they lead at 5G & Drones? Why do they have over 120 Fortune 500 companies? We have a mere 7.
Err because pubs contribute 23bn to GDP. Pay 13bn in tax, or about 10% of the NHS budget.
