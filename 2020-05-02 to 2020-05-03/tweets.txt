Bout to order Chuck E. Cheese pizza and support struggling businesses in this economy. Will report back on the taste.
Simone, our economy has to show wealth. In doing so something that the world will also use.
If everyone had a similar experince that would be one thing but we are talking about a capitalistic economy where healthy products dont make more money therefore are not a value to most companies. Regulations are not inherently bad.
I knew it would be bad. I didn't think it would be this bad. I was worried he would get us into a war and collapse the economy. But what he has done is far worse. And it is all due to his incompetence.
Lol Trump's running away from his record during his presidency! He's trying to run against his 2016 opponent as if that bears any relevance to now!! Trump's incompetence has killed over 66,000 Americans and our economy!! We don't need a repeat and we won't forget!! # Biden
Think about if we wiped out the nursing home numbers, and any subject over 60 w/pre-existing conditions? I think what we need to do is focus these stimulus packages towards the at-risk population, so they can be safe, and we can re-open our economy.
Current focus of the pandemic is two things 1. The impact in countries where the healthcare is less developed 2. Countries slowly (not you Malaysia) try to reopen the economy with exit plans in place Bonus point - will the US be less dumb? Stay tuned (and safe) to find out
No, their infection and death numbers are just like many other countries. But that's the whole point. They literally saved their economy unlike so many other countries, and they are mostly still alive.

It’s a false frame. It’s not economy vs health. You can’t have one without the other. No amount of fear, spin or manufactured outrage will change that.
One of the most frustrating thing about this pandemic is arguing with doctors about the need to sit your ass at home versus opening up the economy and upping the deaths from covid. I mean shouldn’t doctors be the supporters of lowering the infection rate?

These “experts” seem to be more concerned with preventing the resurgence of the American economy; covid is a commercial for totalitarian imposition, promising to inject poisons into the same people now begging for safety.
Actually all of those laws would be comparable to social distancing in an open economy. This shut down is more comparable to a law requiring cars to remain garaged
we are still not doing to enough testing to open our economy. This is pretty risky slowing the testing just to keep the numbers down since we are already having more cases than other countries.

Actually, if you look at a 10 year chart, all he did is ride Obama’s economy until he crashed it. The tax cuts juiced the market, companies bought back their shares inflating their value and sold everything. The 1% made like bandits, everyone else was always going to get screwed.
When it's a loved one who lost their company, or can't pay their employees, it's a 'better safe than sorry'.... We need to deal with threats proportionally, this isn't worth shutting down the world economy for a year. Even the UN said 150M could starve cause of that.

More testing = more cases. They told us that MULTIPLE TIMES. Plus, how many new cases are in prisons or nursing homes, which have NOTHING to do with opening up the economy. Stop the fear mongering for once and report ALL FACTS

He called the CV 19 a hoax, turned down WHO testing, no testing, no PPE, no contact tracing. His hoax resulted in tens of thousands of deaths and put our economy in a tail spin. I donated to John Kasic’s campaign. I put $$$ towards a republican. I don’t hate republicans.
How does that help the economy? Bitcoin or no, people are still not buying as many goods or services, mostly because it is not sensible to do so under the current circumstances. Crashing the bitcoin helps nobody.
He’s gambling that between now and November, the pandemic will be dealt with or “miraculously” go away. That in turn will send the economy into overdrive. Most important for Trump, he will win the election. If the gamble doesn’t work, do you think he will care if a few more die?

Time to shut down the economy, then.
That to the economic collapse, massive bailouts and "too big to fail" policy we got in 08-09! Once deregulation hit in the 70s and beyond the economy has been run by these financial institutions to the mass detriment of the majority of the people. It is more profitable to play

Why is it necessary to tell the people who live in fear of a virus more than 99% of those infected survive, that opening up the economy is NOT FORCING them to go out? If you’re worried about going out, stay at home, but don’t try to make others stay in theirs.

If the average person stops travelling as much, air travel will become a “luxury” item and prices will go up. Airlines earn 5x more on a business class passenger than economy. You can fill a plane with 170 ppl paying $300 or 35 ppl paying $1,500. The latter could happen.

Unfortunately in LA, we’re still wearing masks, sheltering in place, and tanking our “58k” homeless economy! The masks prevent sharing of antibodies to overcome the virus, which means we’re still “at risk” for the # Wuhan pandemic! I thinks it’s called “bad leadership”!
I will reiterate — you said if high risk people asked you nicely to *wear a mask* you would. I never asked you to stay indoors, only wear a mask in indoor public spaces. I’m at high risk of losing my mom and honestly the economy needs her money as much as anyone else’s

Yeah, they said stay at home. Too bad you don't care if people die. You just want them off unemployment and keeping the economy going. Ain't going to happen. Testing has always been inadequate, let alone tracing. Outbreak will continue apace. You're an accomplice to mass murder.

This is baloney you need to open everything now we are responsible for our lives you are ruining our economy. 995 died in Ohio all of Ohio and you shut us down for that
Can we please get a government in that can do their fucking job. This Depression the government is gonna cause on the economy will kill more people in the long term than the fucking viral infection itself. Get the correct numbers of those who died over covid19 not died with it
It has nothing to do with your nationality. The point is that you are wrong. The elderly are dying at an extraordinary rate, and that it due to the lack of measures put in place by Sweden (in order to protect the economy). There is no argument for that.
No of couse I haven't as you know and I value what all our military personnel are doing and have done. I didn't choose that career path, so it is totally unfair to judge me for that! I'm ok with what my value is to the country, the economy and proud to have served the NHS
£15bn boost to economy is a pittance. The GDP damage due to no deal Brexit alone is going to be around 8-12%, or £120billion. USA will insist on their rules and regs.

# OpenTheEconomy OPEN THE FUCKING ECONOMY I want my local mom & pop fast food.
if your economy is the "strongest" why can't you afford to go into lockdown for 4 weeks to prevent the spread of your so-called "china virus" but you can't because your entire economy would collapse.

66k dead Americans. Record unemployment. Market crash. Amoral p-grabber.
Do you know why the country will not open yet? It's because the Care Act everybody that's on unemployment and extra $600 a week on top of what they already made per week so they're making way more money doing nothing then they would at their job. Care Act goes on until July 31st
It’s almost as if we didn’t need to reinvent the unemployment program.
You can be concerned about job losses leading to firm-worker disconnects and more long term unemployment without believing that furloughs are categorically superior.
So I usually get a msg on # ohiounemployment unemployment website saying to file claim tomorrow it’s not there but not msg saying benefits have been stopped wtf

Because our system was not designed for 27 million to file unemployment. Ours or anybody else's. I guess that's Trump's fault too? Ridiculous!!! Use your brain, don't complain, do something. Look at your state. It's the worst in the nation, world.
Somehow 30 million people managed to file for unemployment, and yes it will be retroactive to date unemployed.
And WHOSE fault is it that there are people out of work, unemployment is screwed up & food banks are inadequately stocked while produce rots in the fields? Starts with a t, ends with a rump. His negligence, denial & dishonesty (+ his unqualified appointees) is what got us here.
@ realDonaldTrump NOBODY in California is getting state unemployment let alone the 600.00 per week. NOONE. SAVE us from this idiot Gruesome Newsom
What have they done? Lied about how severe it is, no national plan, lack of testing, lack of healthcare ppe, stealing supplies from states & the VA, highest unemployment since depression & 68k people are died & counting. Great job

600,000 on unemployment. More per capita unemployment than New York. He's done a horrifically poor job of that.
If they are getting PPP they shouldn’t be getting unemployment. The point was to keep them off unemployment.

The unemployment is like in the 1930s though. You aren't going to get a WPA out of the McConnell Senate and the Mnuchin Treasury.
Yup and Murphy never tested the capabilities of the Unemployment office prior to putting 900,000 people out of work. He had time.

finally got approved for unemployment just need the card and I’m gucciiiii
So I got a letter today from unemployment. After filing, and filing a biweekly claim, I have been told that I am ineligible for benefits. The best part, I can't appeal since I would've had to have done that before 4/24 and my letter explaining that came today 5/2.
@ GavinNewsom how about you, and all the other state government politicians, lower your pay to unemployment pay. Then donate the difference to all the small businesses that are currently shutdown. What a show of support that would be.

A search for a job is a search for purpose, a search for a job is a search for food, a search for a job is a search for identity, a search for a job is a search for a home, a search for a job is a search for health, Unemployment is the loss of these.
I spent SIX hours on hold with unemployment today to not even fucking talk to a human or finish my claim so that’s cool l o l
i spent all day playing minecraft is this what unemployment feels like
Right. I have yet to receive unemployment or a stimulus check. I’ve been quarantined this whole time. People aren’t beating down doors to risk exposure and do things for people for free. The majority of the “vulnerable” do not have access to those things. And they cost money.
Not socializing and Stay & Cower at Home severely weakens your immune system. Also, unemployment will wind up killing over a million people. END MARTIAL LAW NOW! https://www.instagram.com/p/B_eLgSun9qh/
Quarantine the people who have health problems, everything else should be going. There are unparalleled levels of unemployment right now, people are losing their jobs, their businesses, and their livelihood every day.
Same here bro. Between the state unemployment and the extra from the fed, we should all be ok for awhile. Those who are having trouble need to be taken care of, and if you know someone struggling, jump in and help. Were all in this together.
Still waiting for unemployment to arrive
There’s people who’ve filed for unemployment 2 months ago and haven’t gotten it. What’s worse is unemployment offices not answering the phones. Shit is sad.
Lowest unemployment rate in a generation, lo inflation & a GDP-to-debt ratio better than most of G7. Alberta was an exception, due largely to lo oil prices
HELLLLLOOOOO why are Pua applicants being ignored since March and people are getting there unemployment in a week. its been 8 weeks with a one time payment of 600 dollars we are humans too and need help please respond someone @ NYSLabor @ NYSLabor

the way a lot of you talk about unemployment as if it’s a “free ride” lol people aren’t fucking coasting on unemployment??? and people (like my mother) are being actively denied unemployment so i BEG OF YOU to shut the fuck up!
It’s probably just those who are making more on unemployment than their regular jobs.
Only been working a month so I don’t apply for it. Also owe money on unemployment from a few years ago can’t go on until it’s paid off
I be honest to ya sir if America have them unemployment check we maybe won't see protect on state capital to reopen business

@ realDonaldTrump Maybe instead of reopening we pause all bills like actual pause, then everyone who paid taxes 2018/19 get the basic unemployment. Yes essential workers too. And that extra 600? We figure out how to only allow that for food for the month.
Right! No need to drag down those who are collecting unemployment, especially when it wasn’t there decision to leave work.

If businesses in some states that are allowed to reopen stay closed they can’t file interrupted business claims and if workers don’t go to work they can’t get unemployment. Gives new meaning to dying to get back to work.
It is time to end federal unemployment for all. Only people who are themselves high risk or have high risk dependents. This should not turn into a welfare thing.
It’s great @ BillGates is working on # COVID19 but there shouldn’t be any billionaires in the world. Period. He just bought a $43 million oceanfront estate while 30 million Americans filed for unemployment & thousands of Americans are sleeping in their cars in line at food banks.

Wake up and learn that that gives media carte blanche to spread any lie they want-which is what they are doing on a daily basis. Have you ever asked yourself why they never report on the good things President Trump is doing? Under him, black unemployment is at an all-time low.
Unemployment lagging. No Stimulus check. And I’ve been blessed. It took the worst shit to happen to come out stronger than I’ve been in a long time.
It is time to stop the federal unemployment!!! The intention was good but there was no accounting for abuse of the system. There are jobs but people just don't want to work. Only give the federal to people at risk or that have dependents at risk.

I literally pay taxes on wages paid from marijuana businesses and collected federal unemployment when those businesses closed just because something is federally illegal doesn’t mean it’s not legal in a state. Keep reaching my dude.
I agree. I’m saying they money could have really helped those who can’t make rent and buy groceries. So many haven’t received unemployment or a stimulus check while a million dollars was raised and no one knows where it actually went.
& right as i started to get settled into my new position; the virus happened / everything got shut down & we were furloughed. unfortunately, my unemployment benefits will not be coming through for another three weeks after today & i just don't know what to do.
black colleges have been funded for decades, black unemployment is lower by 1.7% under trump before the virus , btw OBAMA had it lower by 5.2%, setting a record isn't really great is you didn't have far to reach it, OBAMA gave him a great start
Then file for unemployment.
Lock down is Democrats & left medias tactic for power grab, because more people will go to unemployment, economic will look at, Trump will be hurt. SEE, set up: https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10220286799173696&set=gm.578186929456241&type=3&theater …

The Trump regime has been totally inept handling the coronavirus in the USA, with the cost of most deaths and a third of world cases, record unemployment, record debt and deficit and it is still out of control. Australia needs to keep borders to the USA closed. # Insiderspic.twitter.com/tCttLjXEXA

More relevant to now; the Spanish Flu of 1918 lasted 2 yrs. What's wrong with us? 2 months in & we're falling apart as a country, pointing fingers & protesting simple life-saving advice. (SMH). And even though the "system" is broken; they didn't have SS, unemployment or EBT
I do and I am blessed but I too have friends with company’s they had to close forever, People with no income but unemployment. But why is this worth your life, or your families, or the people that are looking like sardines on a street asking to get sick?
Thanks for waking up finally, now you must stop blaming Trump on US corona deaths and unemployment numbers.

My work has evaporated for the time being. However, I'm not filing for unemployment because A) we had some money saved and B) I never have and C) since this crisis will likely last a year or more I'm going to figure out what to do next because this is likely the "new normal".
Hearing all of these people brag about making more $ now on unemployment makes me sick
It says my sister eligible for 10k in total for unemployment she waiting on her debit card rn wow lucky asf
"Common courtesy" isn't mass poverty ordained by a minor official ordaining sky-high unemployment, nil quality of life. Get f---ing real.
The people being economically crushed, for a reason that is not proven, is running into the MILLIONS. 30m filed for unemployment insurance. How many don't qualify but desperately need help? Why is this NOT part of the equation??? I for one will take the risk, for their sake.
Still wondering Can the $600. extra unemployment money be removed in the next bill All that does is keep the economy from opening All that had to be done was the stimulus bill could make up the difference from states money to 90% or 100% of pay why the bonus?
And he's going to end his presidency with the worst unemployment and worst economy since the Great Depression...because he couldn't lead when we needed him the most.
I wonder if the "iTs mY rIgHt tO wOrK, THEY TOOK'ER JOBS" people will be as excited to get back at it if we reopen too early, shut down, open back up the second time for less pay than unemployment and half their co-workers are dead

The entire unemployment system in Florida is screwed up! My son has been unemployed for five weeks, and has only seen one check.
Nope, you haven’t done shit for us. You did stuff for folks in jail, I’m not in jail. Your “unemployment” was for everyone and you just changed the program. You only had them on it for a few weeks then they weren’t counted. What have you done for black people. Nothing FOH
If they have a trillion dollars to give out they can give the people money for food. We all pay into unemployment there should be money there for us for a limited time. This is the government’s actual job, keep its people safe.

The market looks forward 6 months to a year or more. Current economics are day to day now or backward looking. People on unemployment are only thinking about the immediate future. The market is looking at Microsoft or Amazon next year. Perspective.
Sad to see many say, "if you're afraid to get sick stay home. Let the rest of us have freedom." Many Americans have underlying conditions. If govt isn't declaring public health crisis, ppl either choose their lives or their job if they are expected to work. Fired? No unemployment

https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000006 … The black unemployment rate under trump started at 7.5% and lowered it down to 5.8% before the virus a difference of 1.7% ,, OBAMA started at 12.7% that rose to 16,8% and lowered it down to 7.5% a difference of 5.2% or 9.3%, trump isn't even close to it
Political expediency that results in the ignoring of the Bill of Rights and of warning signs the minority voices concerns over. The rush to shut down the economy for two weeks has now been six+. The extension and generosity of unemployment means people don’t want to work.
I like presidents who get things done! Prison reform. Permanent funding for Historically Black colleges and Univ. Opportunity zones to help Black Businesses and communities. Halting illegal immigration that drove down wages for Black workers. Lowest Black unemployment...

The economy matters to the average American. If it’s good they re-elect people, if it’s bad they toss out old people and vote in new ones. Don’t pretend that the unemployment rate, or inflation, or whatever doesn’t have real world consequences for real people.
Nice to know putting in 40 hours a week at target gets you less than unemployment
(6) And most maddening of all, some of the Republicans who complained the loudest about how $600 unemployment checks would give workers a "perverse incentive" to stay home are the same people OK with giving multi-billion dollar businesses a perverse incentive to risk our lives.

Social safety nets should be there to serve their perpose. That doesn't mean that we create so many problems that everyone has to rely on them. I also disagree that lockdowns save lives. How many people will commit suicide due to unemployment & social isolation?
Um, if the unemployment system worked, they would be less anxious. How about get these folks their unemployment or PUA. It’s been 5 weeks.
Some were concerned about getting a certain candy for Easter while others were concerned if there would be enough bread, milk and eggs for the weekend. Some want to go back to work because they don't qualify for unemployment and are running out of money.

Im convinced I’m never gonna hear from unemployment. I try calling and can never get through. Monday will be 2 weeks since I filed.....
people are making more off of unemployment and the stimulus check than i am working my essential job as a nurse
I am not negating your sentiment-it is a bit unfair. But to be honest, I'd do anything right now to be able to go back to work and get paid. No unemployment no paycheck for 7 weeks now. Whole situation is terrible.
NO!. That is the point. The unemployment benefit just before the # COVID__19 was $250 a week. The Govt doubled it when the virus broke out, so $500 a week. But the Business class (BTW this guy has 3 houses, one overseas holiday home) get $750 a week. # auspol
What is BS is if the workers don’t feel safe abc leave their jobs they won’t get unemployment. And more than likely these companies won’t offer paid time off or sick time. The masks protect the people around you not the wearer

For some that live alone they're facing endless loneliness. While for others it is peace, rest & time with their mother, father, sons & daughters. With the $600 weekly increase in unemployment some are bringing in more money to their households than they were working.

!!! But, I read yesterday in some states, if an "essential worker" doesn't go to work, they can't get unemployment bc of the rule: "If you voluntarily quit your job w/out good cause, you won't be eligible for benefits". Good cause? I think so. We probably will see court cases.

I wonder if the people who were part of the poll are receiving the extra unemployment compensation and have no incentive to get back to work. They may find out the jobs are gone when they get around to looking for work again when the check stops coming.
Don’t have a cat, but I’m so sorry. Just be persistent and patient applying for unemployment. Don’t know where you’re from but I know WW, CA and NY systems overwhelmed but keep trying, you will get it eventually. Good luck!

Funny since 30 million Americans filed for unemployment since March Wonder how that rate looks today? Gonna be some crow for yet another republican economic meltdown is in full swing Gonna be worse than 2008 under Bush Jr
Notice there has been no pressure put on any nonessential white-collar sector of the economy to restart. Only blue-collar, low-wage, front facing service employees. The same ones who most benefit from enhanced unemployment. Stay woke. That’s what all this is about.
The generous unemployment is $400 base + $600 bonus per week... $4000 a month... are you arguing for a pay cut?
Almost all of those deaths in Democratic states. If we take away the death toll in their own states due to poor local governance, this shutdown would not have been necessary and we’d still have record unemployment.
Love seeing other folks make more off unemployment + stim
Guys it’s been over a month and I still haven’t gotten approved for unemployment which rich person should I eat first

Yes I am better off. I have corona and unemployment. Didn’t have all that a few years ago.
Not all biz owners. I am spending my PPP on payroll only to keep my 15 employees out of the clogged unemployment system for now. As of July 1, I'll have to lay them all off because I doubt congress has anymore relief coming our way. But, I was able to keep them for 2 months.
Sweden is not a good example nor a good comparison. The state governments want to reopen so they don’t have to pay unemployment benefits. Don’t sacrifice workers on the altar of capitalism. Wise up.

Seeing the WSJ freak out about people getting actual wage replacement from unemployment was something else. The entire point is having people stay at home! We want them not to work right now! I do wonder if this will be a boon for some people, as they get a big cash infusion.
Fuck his cries about unemployment tab. Once it’s open it’s open for a year. That being said he already paid into for the back years which is where they get there money. They won’t get it in the future. He sounds like a bitch crying over that fact to me
How much of this happened to you? Im sure you have poked people for “playing the victim”, seeing the numbers people are getting on unemployment and ill tell ya its more than im making working my job

They should be happy to not be in the unemployment line with the Palomar nurses. It's probably a fake protest anyway. The Administrators will fire anyone that speaks out.
Are there Academic Models of what happens to standard of living when 30 M are unemployed, unemployment rate is 20%, retirement savings tanking for those over 65,, GDP declining 2% per quarter?
Cool. You knew this already but it was a conspiracy theory earlier? K... nice chatting with you. Good luck with your unemployment claim. I personally hope everyone gets back to work.
75% payroll + need 8% of that amount of your own money for payroll tax. Net about 18% for rent. Old employees want to stay on unemployment and stores can’t open. Employers are paying Friends and family to match headcount and spend dollars. Is it fraud?
https://nypost.com/2020/04/20/explaining-the-link-between-unemployment-deaths-amid-coronavirus/ … Here is an interesting article about unemployment rates and deaths as a result. We are sort of screwed either way. “Every 1 percent unemployment goes up, 40,000 people die. Did you know that?” -Brad Pitt, The Big Short
It’s more than that though. They are spending money to pay employees (also now they are ineligible for unemployment benefits), business not making any money, potentially exposing staff to the virus. The cost-benefit analysis is unbelievably lopsided and dumb.
Trump gave us the worst economy ever! Unemployment is at record high! Why do Republicans always fuck up the economy?

I believe that no party wanted a recession on their watch. Now that's its going to be a reality, all of the hard decisions will be made. What party is going to be elected promoting Big Australia, while unemployment sits above 10%. Labor getting ahead of the curve.
Desperately need money!! If anyone can help that would be much appreciated. I have yet to receive my unemployment or my stimulus check and literally only have .17$ in my bank account. I haven’t eaten in a couple days so anything would help

Don't do it. They can draw unemployment benefits and survive.
I rcvd a call from an adjudicator. It felt like an interrogation. I was immediately defensive, because of the person's tone. I was then denied unemployment because I quit a job on Feb 28th and hadn't worked at my new one for 7 weeks when I was laid off due to the virus.

and black unemployment BEGAN to go down when Obama was president.
Youth unemployment is forecast to skyrocket, and the future is uncertain for so many young people. The government should be doing everything it can to make life a little easier for them by putting some more money back into their pockets.
How is it caring for Wisconsin citizens, withholding unemployment benefits? How is it caring for Wisconsin citizens, destroying Wisconsin family businesses and livelihoods?
I got lucky because I was laid off from my job when the pandemic started and ended up getting fired during the time while I was laid off and now I'm living in limbo getting way more unemployment money than I made in a week working there

unemployment finally called me mannn give me ALLLLLL my money !
Speedway gave their employees a $2 hazard duty pay increase and decreased their hours, so they’re making less money. Go to a small business with pride. Essential workers are making less money than people collecting unemployment.

Unemployment also followed a trend that started in 2013, if you were able to research you would know this. Some other things you should look at are the tax reform and what it has done to the real middle class. Even now, the wealthy have benefited from the socialist bailout.
Yes to say the least. I’ve never filed for unemployment in my life. My first experience with it has not been pleasant. To top it off the #they provide you to call nobody answers, you can’t wait in a queue, or get a call back, so you can’t proceed. I’ve made hundreds of calls.

The cash position is one single indicator of how the "Oracle of Omaha" is seeing the current stock market. Do you believe that Warren's increase liquidity is because of some greater scheme? Or do you believe that he is expecting the market to crash further?

my dad asked me if he was edgy bro your favorite hobby is the stock market i think that’s all you need to know
The most glaring number which came out was that he has $137 bi in cash which means that Warren is either planning to increase his liquidity before he buys another company or he does not believe that stocks are rightly priced even with stock market crashing in March

Shutting others out and patronising every lucrative contract to the exclusion of other citizens is what you call legitimate business?
Oregon has counties the size of US states (Harney County = Massachusetts) and these supposed COVID deaths are 99% in the Portland metro. That governor had no business shutting down the economy at all in any part of Oregon other than the cesspool (Portland).
Excellent! China shud never b allowed to buy any business in this country. They already own Smithfield & Tyson foods. Cud that have anything to do w/those packaging plants shutting down. They just got a gov’t ok to purchase sum oil field in Texas.
I totally understand restaurants and small business being upset. Time to open. It don’t complain about fed govt shutting you down. Electric and other bills associated with opening with no customers because Americans were sheltered in place would have hurt as well
Funny...I think you spoke that statement into a mirror. And clearly you’re being facetious.. perhaps you just should stick to hammering your animals, because if you don’t feel that leaders shutting down business and commerce, while infringe on freedom is tyranny..you’re far left

MSME shutting down only helps their cronies. I bet the big business are enjoying seeing them fall so they can take their market. Someone gains if small business closes.
This corona is a financial virus just crippling everything, attaching itself and wrecking havoc to business. It’s not shutting down the economy. The economy is already shut down. It’s not the best thing that has happened but it’s bigger than we understand.
Local business I had supported for years is shutting down for good today. Shit.
Forget holidays and tourists, conduct of business requires travellers to move between countries easily. If every journey had to include two weeks locked in a hotel room you would basically be shutting down most international trade.

Having read the article I'm even more confused about the journalism business than I was before (legit confused, not sarcastic) but now agree that the closing of the local papers was a tragedy. I assumed there was a lack of demand but it's just the virus shutting everything down.
Perhaps, if you could think past the first level. The slogans are highlighting the Governor Pritzker is a Nazi for locking everyone in their homes and shutting down business. But that would be to much logic for you to handle.

It's so infuriating when air head girls just blabber about how everyone should just shut down and stay home fee eh yaaaani. It hits me how ignorant and conceited they are every time I'm checking on a business owner friend who's on the verge of laying off people or shutting down.
Destruction of people's welfare is the opposite of his job. We've already lost the housing market and many businesses which were unprepared for their government shutting them out (while leaving corporations like Lowes open.) Every day closed is someone's last day in business.

Not impressed big box Corp open and shutting down small business. Corp America is evil not for the people.
People don’t know history — calling them protestors who want to reopen businesses “Nazis” is completely inaccurate. Calling the people who are shutting down business & telling people they mustn’t gather “Nazis” would certainly be more historically accurate.
Thanks to the governor forgiving you your rights back?! The governor didn’t creat your business you did. The governor stole your rights by shutting it down.

Actually, no. There is no law that keeps any small business owner from shutting down their business. So, GFY!
It's all hypothetical. Doing nothing is one thing. Shutting down & destroying the nation is quite another. There is an in-between that should have been done. Close borders, quarantine arrivals, social distancing and increased infection control. Other than that business as usual
Dental offices where everyone was already wearing masks and every item is disinfected between patients. Why is Bill Lee directly shutting down that business?
So, if every employee quits and goes to the business down the street because of shitty working conditions, it’s “threatening”. Bargaining is absolutely libertarian. There’s nothing libertarian about blindly shutting up and having no checks and balances on corporations.

These governors shutting down these businesses could make a person snap. A person that is older loses his business his house bank account could make a person retaliate. They should really think if they want to keep pushing towards the cliff. Some one might turn around.

Oh my. You don’t think our GDP affects us? As much as I’d love to give you a lesson on macroeconomics, I don’t have time or space here. lol I can assure you that GDP does have an impact on daily life. lol I am a teacher. It was not a slight on teachers. Just on Trudeau.
GDP India's was highest then
And they have no potential to have done more ,? I'm just asking, Singapore a city/state with Lagos has an economy of over $360bn projected to be $590bn soon with a GDP per capita of $63k . Those are the criteria to judge a working economy. Don't just Google, learn economics too
Trust the market! Restarting medical procedures restricted will make a big difference. “Collapsing” is a bit of an exaggeration. GDP down 4% in March. Probably down more in May but very temporary.

If you consider a reduction in the rate of increase as a cut and only an increase in the rate of spending as acceptable then in one generation NHS spending would be well over 50% of GDP that would bankrupt both the economy and the NHS Is that your socialist dream?
Unemployment in Sweden also jumping, GDP also dropping. So it's not as if the counterfactual is "1300 people die and the economy looks the exact same as it did this time last year".
2/2 Our government also committed a 4% GDP stimulus package to support the economy. in the US that equate to approx $800 billion. That’s how you do this right.

The US moonshot program cost 4% of GDP, but only for 10 years. Here, where time is less of the essence, 1-10% seems reasonable b/c such a high portion would have the *necessary* side-effect of raising global consciousness to our higher-than-acknowledged vulnerability to folly.

Idk how they come up with these numbers. Every gender has the right of agency and this is surely good for economic welfare. However, don't take GDP as absolute measure of welfare. Switch housewives, pay them salaries and GDP will increase. Value can be other than market price.

That is based on data that assumes the GDP shrinkage as well as the increase in unemployment will be single digits only. Now lets revise that drop in tax collection for a 6-8 month partial lockdown, 23% GDP shrinkage, >50% unemployment. https://twitter.com/MagnusHeystek/status/1256496778733596672 …

The Fed balance sheet is twice as large as it was during the Great Depression & WW2. And GDP grew by 5% in the 40s & 50s. This past resilience shows how strong we & capitalism can be if the Fed would stop inflating economic bubbles. @ LbrtyAmndmnts @ gabriel_arisi @ funkybewbs2pic.twitter.com/Z69b0KRgki

According to the report of the Groningen University, Netherlands, when India was ruled by Akbar, the Indians were richer than people of France, Germany, America, China and Japan because the Per Capita GDP of Indians was more than the current developed countries of the world.
Even foreign debt to GDP can be misleading if you export revenue is either weak or volatile. Debt should be measured relative to ability to repay (foreign savings + net export + access to market/ credit lines) rather than GDP. The data is correct, the measures not very useful.

Lies. Manufacturing was way up. And it wasn’t about that. He was referencing GDP and other things too. And either way, I only trust President Trump to get us back. Joe’s an freakin idiot.
You can't compare a country with a fraction of our GDP and resources to us. Did you forget that we're the #1 producer of oil in the world too?
Chinese Wuhan’s virus is in my personal opinion not real facts was created to lower the population, stop Hong Kong protesters, stop President Trump from winning, shrink GDP, exceed low Unemployment, job losses and bring down the stock market. Make America a Socialist Country.
Kenya and Uganda, there’s business and GDP right there to start exporting to Southern and West Africa, before bazungu starts, but they should be green please
Would love to. Sadly %GDP expenditure on healthcare determined by Government in our democracy & the people repeated voted for real term reductions in spend. That comes with real limitations in practice.
On a serious note, the chart proves the defect of the parameters used. For instance, debt as a percentage of GDP makes no sense when you have a high cost of borrowing and an abysmal revenue to GDP ratio. And your import cover may actually be measuring just how poor you are.

(Yes it would also kill many more as the hospitals are filled with Coronavirus patience and cannot treat anyone else, it would also ruin the economy and take down some GDP.)
Yeah, 30 Million unemployed and -30% GDP doesn't jive with markets making new highs. I understand that the Fed is printing like crazy but that's just a band aid.
Akala ko OFWs are considered economic heroes of the country because of our significant contribution towards the growth of the Philippine economy. Remittances sent by OFWs take part of the total GDP of the country.
I know right? I mean prior to this pesky plandemic...it wasn't like we had the greatest economy in USA history under Trump's leadership. Lowest unemp across the board. Deregulation. Rcd breaking stock market. Impressive GDP. 6mil off food stamps. Lower taxes. Manufacturing+trade!
Everyone wants a fair shot at achieving success. Capitalism can be redesigned with different measurements of GDP. Adjust GDP measurements towards metrics of mass happiness. If government was worth anything they would make this happen. We need a complete overhaul. # repairamerica

Well, it is true because I have never seen any Nigerian leader pointing to any other sector as a source for improving our GDP it is basically only on oil that's found in the south & my question is what is the north bringing to the table as a source for Nigeria?

The outbreak also sent overall economic activity spiraling lower during the first quarter, with a 4.8% GDP. contraction. That was the biggest U.S. economic downturn since the financial crisis.

Kaduna State has a per capita level of $1, 666 & its GDP is estimated at $10.334 billion. It's the 10th richest State in Nigeria and 2nd in Northern Nigeria. Its saddening to read that @ GovKaduna @ elrufai is deducting 25% of workers salaries. It shows lack of empathy.

Lol guys. The chart tells you exactly what they are ranking. Nigeria ranks high on those particular metrics. It is not a measure of diversity of export base, tax-to-gdp, or other measures on which Nigeria is weak. This is like saying, if it doesn’t fit my paradigm, its trash.
Even prior to Covid, Trump’s stock market growth, GDP growth and employment growth percentages UNDERperformed Obama’s. After Trump’s denial of and shameful non-response to Covid-19, his economic performance ought to be compared - UNFAVORABLY - to Herbert Hoover’s post-1929

Population takes care of itself when education is the priority. Children are not for security in old age. Avg household size declines, fewer children born, but adults then work longer. Do group self-care like Golden Girls. That's a social change. GDP plateaus 1%. Long, slow life.
What do MAGAs like most about Trump? The 25M unemployed, the over 60k dead, the negative GDP, the dictator coddling, the ruinous deficits, the fact that he’s made America a laughingstock, the bigotry, or the cultish slobbering? I bet it’s the bigotry.

Could have said the same thing in 2008, Wall Street is not Main Street, as long as the dollar is the world currency, we're ok. Our GDP is 80% consumer spending, add that trillions by the Fed, you have something. Who does inflation hurt though? Not the top 1% who hold the assets.

2x expansion from the FED seems likely given current scenarios, GDP contraction to $18T and FED balance sheet to 10T and will still only be at 55% of GDP, plenty of inflation room left. Which will only cause a further concentration of wealth and decimation of equality.
