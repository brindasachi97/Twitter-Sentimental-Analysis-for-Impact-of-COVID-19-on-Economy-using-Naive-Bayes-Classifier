million times better than the US UK or Japan Germany has a 10 savings rate and a massive trade surplus The US UK Canada and Australia have massive trade deficits Thank you Okay poor choice of words Ireland has an inflated GDP due to multinationals taking advantage of the low level of corporation tax and I cannot see any evidence that the Irish people are wealthier than the people in the UK I
