Kinda glad Labor lost just so the general public can blame (rightfully) liberals incompetence. When an economy goes down it usually takes down the incumbent party for good.
They reckon that spending billions and billions on anything will lead to a good economy and won’t do any damage to the environment. It’s like they are naturally retarded. They’re just a very strange and dangerous bunch

The concept that presidential candidate effects are real but quite small and instead elections are more about stuff like the economy etc is a pretty simple concept but a lot of people find it really hard to accept.
Oil is down 18%, Stock futures down over 1,000 points and 30 year at about .5%. Whether this is rational or not, this is a serious impact to the economy. We need to be on a war time footing or this could spin out of control (more than it has). # coronavirus # COVID19
Anything else would be false economy, surely??
TBH I don’t think they are even doing that very well. The way to minimise the impact on the economy is to minimise the impact on the population. The current policy of reassurance has at best a short term effect, and frankly even that doesn’t seem to be working.

It's remarkable how the US economy has evolved to the point that oil crashing through the floor is a net negative, both because production has become a fairly big share of our economy AND because the rest of the economy is less energy intensive per dollar output.
Well pay attention to the future. Given a little time, that issue will be handled. He won't put his face on their ads if they don't fix that. Thats how sad it will get, if they try to cover it up or ignore the problem. Its a problem for that whole country as their economy stinks.
Biden: "Ensure workers in the “gig economy” and beyond receive the legal benefits and protections they deserve. Employer misclassification of “gig economy” workers as independent contractors deprives these workers of legally mandated benefits and protections" Pretty oppressive.
Why would they do that? Always self-interest of course. Trump wants good economy for reelection, just like Wuhan local officials don't want to any big fuss before chinese new year. So they covered it up and think they can handle it quietly.

Sanders’ mission to help the poor and middle class is admirable. But he must also assure swing voters that the economy will trend up, you can keep your doctor, his plans are debt neutral, etc. Wealth redistribution alone is not enough of a plan to win the general.
Given that the economy is your concern you should be pushing for investment in education as for every $1 there is a $1.30 return. Why would you throw away a 30% return? Better than putting your $ anywhere else.

To be clear, Biden is awful. His policies are at best tepid and most often dangerous for anyone non-white and non-wealthy. Sanders’ vision for housing, the economy, climate are much better for all of our country and the world. & Trump will mop the floor with Biden. 1/2

Stephen Poloz on Thursday: "Commodity prices are a very important channel for transmitting international shocks to the Canadian economy." Today: Oil prices plummet 31%. Things are about to get ugly.
It really depends on how long it lasts and which countries get it under control. It will effect the economy but we really don't know how much at this point.
We must re-elect President Donald Trump, a Democrat will destroy the economy, increase taxes, slice and dice Social Security and Medicare. We will have open borders, high crime. And no rule of law. America Must Vote Republican, America must Elect Republicans
I'd add that compromise isn't bad and is often needed. It's just that Biden has a longer record of working with Republicans to get their agenda done than maybe our Democratic nominee should when we're looking to fix our broken democracy and our undemocratic economy.

Actually, it would grow the economy from the massive construction and production that would be needed to transition. It’s best that we take the lead in green tech, lest we be left behind, because the world is moving that way and China is beating us to it.
@ SpeakerPelosi @ RepMaxineWaters You really need to look into whether or not Trump is ordering the Fed to prop the stock market up. That doesn’t benefit the economy, just investors, and his re-election through a false sense of security.

Might be worth comparing what Don Jr./Trump Inc. has to do to earn $996,000/year in profit. Hotel margins are about 10% so they would need to earn approx. $10M in revenue to get what Hunter pocketed. 90% of that would go to wages, food/bev, taxes, etc. which add to the economy.
On collapse in oil prices: the structure of the US economy has profoundly changed. Yes, gasoline prices drop, but the decline in fixed business investment will likely offset positives in consumption as long as households don’t pull back. Second, credit market issues in high yield
He. is. delusional. if he had a way to create a booming economy why’d he wait 7 years to implement this clever plan..? Trump did it in 1 year & his trying now to take credit for all of POTUS’ hard work makes him look even lazier than he did before https://twitter.com/blaze0497/status/1236690209623990272 …
Also, give the Glory to God for Obama! God gave Obama the strength and tenacity to run the marathon needed to get unemployment down to 4.5%! So trump could waddle over the fininsh line by adding one percent.
You do know in other developed countries like the UK, where they have universal credit. Unemployed people get considerably far less for unemployment benefits then here. I know because l was over there. I can understand the governments position too.

Wow, unemployment is a major impact. I didn't even know about this one. Masculinity and the expectations of men, it's detrimental to their Mental health and wellbeing, PTSD by those who have suffered a trauma - lifelong damage, Substance abuse - alcohol and drugs.
You know I was watching one of the democrat guys talking and he was saying all of the things trump should be saying, namely long term unemployment. People are going to need $$. Have the republicans even discussed this? Seriously wonder.
Yes, Ma'am. Your facts go hand in hand with your truths. That means that you believe whatever the heck you want to believe. The black low unemployment is no thanks to Obama, who said that manufacturing jobs were not comming back. He gave up on that. His succesor didn't.
That’s it and also UBER Eats, they get such little money. People wouldn’t do these jobs if there was a well paying job for them. Unemployment is far higher than the government will admit to.
for the average citizen this is a marginal increase in risk for them. Panicking will not make their life expectancy any longer, in fact it might shorten it. In fact, If people unnecessarily isolate they will reduce demand in the economy resulting in unemployment.
Black unemployment went from 16% to 7%, Black farmers finally got compensation, Black women had the highest rate of new business start ups, the civil rights division of the Justice department set up, anti discrimination polices in housing and education passed all under Obama.
Actually thats not true. Obama didnt do as much for blacks as trump did. The lower unemployment came from trump, along with the prison reforms. Obama really didn't hold up on his promises compared to trump. Try leaning off the fake news

So you say solve the problem with more unemployment so less money circulates in the economy. Spending creates employment but you are advocating increased unemployment --> less spending --> reduced economic growth. The Govt's surplus = private sector deficit. Explain yourself
She’s a big mouth bitch. Obama did nothing for her or any black person except being a black Muslim. TRUMP is helping the black people, yes, black unemployment is The lowest ever because of Trump.

She forgot to mention that under Obama more people were on food stamps – so how in the hell can Obama create the lowest recorded black unemployment ever? To this day?! This woman is off her rocker. Fox News needs to let her go!!!!
Donna Donna Donna. Don't you know we have statistics of unemployment during the Obama admin? Obama did nothing but line his pockets so he could retire a multi millionaire.
Um the economy just added 273k jobs last month. Lowest unemployment at all levels. Manufacturing is moving back to The USA. And remind me again who’s more interested in corporations?
Nigeria! Basic things seems hard and luxury,when I said @ LMCNPFL is an organised church league to cut down unemployment people doubt me. 0 security in stadiums,match officials & players constantly attacked,now no medical help/facilities in so called professional league.tufikawa
and why does life have to be hard work? automation is projected to soon put unemployment at 90%. will you still be yelling at people to work hard, when there are no more jobs? when it’s clearly not ther fault, but the fault of a broken system? will you still blame the individual?
Oh Henrik you’re so lost, so deceived & so brainwashed it’s pathetic! Breaking down our economy? Tell me you’re not that misinformed? Record low unemployment, consumer confidence through the roof, job growth booming (273,000 in Feb alone), wage increasing, VA accountability,....
Wrong - even if you think a federal minimum wage is a good idea (which it isn't), indexing it to inflation is a terrible one. We actually sort of run this experiment from '78 onward & ended up w/ highest unemployment rate since WW II.
What drivel. Record low unemployment, 1000s of families receiving more support, record high wage growth, average earners 10.5% better off, min wage earners $6300 pa better off, gdp growth in top of OECD, extended parental leave, improved road safety, 18000 kids out of poverty
So explain how bad unemployment is, GDP, Stock Market highs, multiple +trade deals,Jerusalem US Embassy, IRAN terrorist killed, IRAN quieted thru strenght. Borders getting protected, 1st step program, Built up our miltary, show media/Dem corruption. All good!
When I see idiotic comments like Midler's, I think, "Yeah, everybody hates all the prosperity, low unemployment & promises kept under Trump." Also, why aren't these imbeciles condemning Biden & Bernie for their misogynistic comments & inappropriate touching of women & children?
my job has been adversely affected by shutdowns around the globe--my last pay check was $28.63. I draw unemployment parttime during normal seasonal affects. I have one meager unemployment check left. so i'm screwed
Except...Unemployment peaked at 24.9 percent in '33 the year FDR took office and guided the US out of the Great Depression. Then it was in single digits until Bush wrecked the economy with unregulated capitalism. Happy to help clarify for ya!
Further, when President Trump took office: "the Federal Reserve's median forecast had the unemployment rate inching up toward 5 percent, almost 1.5 percentage points higher than the current 50-year low."
The first thing every person employed should do is check their Employee Benefits for a Short Term Disability benefit. Check when it kicks in and what it pays. Next, check the state’s unemployment benefit as well as if the state has its own disability benefit. Last, FMLA regs.
In 2015 unemployment was about 12%. It's now 6. That's exactly "considerably less common.

There are a lot of low-wage workers in the US who aren't given health insurance through their employer, or through the government, and who can't afford to purchase it themselves. They typically also lack sufficient unemployment and disability insurance US minimum wage is real low
Responding to questions on whether the government would consider raising Newstart to get people spending, Social Services Minister Anne Ruston said the rate of unemployment benefits was for a different debate. Which one? The punish the lazy bludgers debate, Ms Ruston? Shameful.
I don’t think I said they were without problems. I could name several problems. But health care coverage went up, unemployment dropped drastically, and more. And he’s still less objectionable than Sanders and his empty promises.

Mr. Trump I have followed you from start. Hearing unemployment asians,black,spanish. Senior citizens never mentioned. Prexisting condions are held against you with every health insurance co.except obama care, pensions taxed, s.s payments cut to 1/3 of working income. Not fair
@ POTUS if you want to lower unemployment even lower, stop employers from using credit checks. Many of us are qualified for jobs but because we struggled in Obama's economy, our credit ratings are bad. We work hard and cannot get those jobs you've brought back
If what you’re saying is true then staying in the EU is actually not “vital to the prosperity of the UK” as we are basically in a recession and have mass unemployment. So we should look beyond the EU, since as you’ve said our economy is super important. Don’t you think?

I've posted how I see us arriving at a recession by, I think, the 2nd half of 2020 & to about 8% unemployment 1yr after that. There's one possible way to avoid much of that and possibly avoid a recession if not a contraction but it takes PPL to ditch their political glasses.

@ donnabrazile President Trump reduced stifling regulations and created opportunity zones With less regulations business can thrive. That’s why black unemployment is the lowest it’s ever been And that’s why small businesses are thriving Obama was a disaster
Unemployment lowest in over 11 years, much higher wages, biggest housing build since the 1970s, 80,000 + jobs created. Paying down National's debt that they racked up when in govt whilst posting true budget surpluses that National couldn't manage and only dreamed of.

No but I think massive lay-offs, unemployment, and recession is not a good thing.
Unemployment dipped to 4.9 percent last month, down by half since the end of the recession — a clear sign that Americans are back to work. With a tighter labor market, employers have begun to increase wages in order to attract and retain the best talent in their industries.
Thank you to the history of them in order to everyone could destroy at young girl looking more than 25%, unemployment in
In January, MT recommended selling Oil at $62.5 targeting $45. In a client note on Friday, ahead of OPEC & US Unemployment, we cautioned Oil was on key support warning a break targets $25. IB economists may see this as a negative, we see this as a positive for global growth # Oil

Maybe because this recession would be starting with such low unemployment, and would be accompanied by low gas prices?
@redceedar sure, to a point. We’re way past the Goldilocks zone when American oil workers end up on unemployment.
It’s not great for our own producers, their employees and suppliers. It’s a bit like years ago when metal prices would drop globally. We in Sudbury thought “Great, my next car should be cheaper” and maybe it was...but over half of us were too busy fighting unemployment to notice.

The unemployment rate was 4.7% when Obama left office so it dropped a whole 1.2% under Trump. The stock market lost almost three years of value in the last week. So quit acting like Trump lowered unemployment rate 10 points.
This will put an end to the low unemployment. This will put an end to mom and pop thinking about their retirement next year.

3.5% unemployment. You should be able to find a great career path job. Maybe not what you want; but one that would give you what the op referenced. Businesses are starved for the next gen workforce.
His, (Obummer) unemployment rate hit as high as 10%, and even at 4.7% in 2016, it only fell that low because so many Americans of ALL races fell off the charts because they stopped looking for work. # Dems think we don't remember, people were fighting for jobs at # Fastfood
I think this was about Donna Brazile and unemployment numbers. The Seth Rich discussion is in another lane.
Memes apparently don't work. "A 77 percent majority of black Americans say Trump deserves “only some” or “hardly any” credit for the unemployment rate among blacks compared with 20 percent who say Trump deserves significant credit." Apparently they give the credit to Obama...
NOOOOO, what is National Insurance? the clue is in the name 'national' and 'insurance' it is supposed to cover health (the NHS), unemployment and pensions. Everyone who works pays it, therefore they are entitled to use it, claim it and draw it when they retire!
Lowest unemployment in history for minorities. That’s right HISTORY! 3.5 unemployment rate... Lower gas prices. Remember those $4.00 + gas prices under Obama. Energy independence. Fairer trade (USMCA) Return of manufacturing. Criminal Justice reform. Lower taxes..
No, Federal only takes your return if you have late child support, non-taxed Federal debt ( like you owe financial aid $), state debts (like you bought something up here in North Carolina tax-free living in Florida) or owe to ur stated unemployment fund So you fine

It's fortunate then that unemployment is at 3.5 percent so employers are not likely to let trained ppl go.. typical recovery 2 weeks could be devastating for some. But paid leave, vacation days, families and churches. We'll see if it becomes widespread. I don't think it will.
The coronavirus will hurt the economy, but the fact is, it was humming along, with record employment and historic low unemployment, rising wages, plus a market that was through the roof.

Sorry to butt in, but rate of job production will be higher when there's a lot of labor of the sidelines as during 2009 to 2016.

You tell them, Terrence. Brazile is a rusted-on, true Dumo who is affected by TDS. The ex-DNC chair is cheerleader for Obuma The Great. Like all Dumos only see & tout his 'legacy'! Sad that she refuses to accept Pres Trump's successes esp in lowest 'black unemployment' EVER!

T1 diabetics have legitimate concern of dying every day. whether it’s from a severe low glucose episode during sleep or unemployment leading to insulin rationing. like its so easy to die and we have to accept that we may not wake up again every time we lay our heads down at night
So we need to redefine “Unemployment Insurance” to fit the circumstances. Reduced hours, but still employed? Let’s make up the difference. Sick? Manadate sick leave under the unemployment ins. umbrella. On furlough? Gap wages w/o having to look for a new job. Etc.
Well, except for his parentage and ~40 years of unemployment.
Hey Terrence, u do know that according to the @ BLS_gov t that trump uses from time to time to tweet low blk unemployment rates can easily be looked up. In 2010 the blk unemployment was at 16.8%.

The most dramatic drop in black unemployment came under Obama. Also, black households had a HIGHER median income prior to Trump.
Too bad unemployment is a shitty metric and doesn't reflect the reality of the situation
_Unemployment Is Really Bad, How Can You Be Online The Whole Day?_
By the time Obama left office the Recession was over, the DOW had gone from 6-7,000 to 19,000, unemployment rate went from 10% to 4.5%, and he was paying down the deficit by $500,000,000 per year. P.S. Benghazi was investigated 8 times by Congress and they found nothing. (A)
So a chiba made virus is Trumps fault? The economy plumitting because the media over reacting to a disease less deadly than the flu is Trumps fault? And you're accusing the guy who's oversaw thelowest unemployment in minority communities ever and won civil rights award a racist?
OMG - she is deranged in that speech. Praising Obama for low black unemployment. Get a grip sister!
Mini pandemic. Then take out an industry Trump really hasn't cared about Oil. Which then would create a sky rocket in the unemployment number and create a waterfall effect in the overall US ECONOMY. ALL ENGINEERED BY OTHER COUNTRIES. IE CHINA (corona) RUSSIA..Saudi (oil) ETC.
Who is to say secretly Russia and Saudi aren't conspiring against the US? Bring US shale to its knees and create a domino effect in the US economy. Layoffs and bankruptcies. With unemployment at it's low this would change quick. Where would people in that industry find jobs
We already have that, it's called National Insurance and everyone who works, pays it. It is supposed to cover health, pensions and unemployment!
Mike: Trump's Economy: -Ballooned annual deficits, 2019 & 2020, to $1trillion plus from Obama's $564billion -A meager 2.1% economic growth -5.7% black unemployment is a meager 1% reduction from Obama's 6.7% -Farmers need welfare -Markets in need of Repo injections of moneys
I can't believe she is so delusional to say black unemployment is low because of Obama. Smh
They need to immediately address the growing poverty and unemployment rates? Stop hiding and ignoring it?

You mean, people that work? At 3.5% unemployment, your argument would appear moot. Not that we don’t need to increase wages across the board, but that will require a reversal of legislative, regulatory and judicial actions since Reagan.

On a german show they said if they get more cases they would shut down schools, factories, stores etc. which would lead to temporary unemployment if they aren’t making any money.Maybe that’s why Trump doesn’t want people tested bc more cases mean we have to quarantine more !!

Unemployment doesnt account for people not looking for a job who arent working. A lot of people have given up looking for a new job. Why is the labor participation rate saying 12 million people are working.
This is another factor that contributes to the high unemployment rate in Nigeria. Education is NOT cheap anywhere and people often think that the 150k they paid in school is a lot. I still wonder why @ OgbeniDipo never mentioned this when he had that chat with Maupe though.

Lowest unemployment rate in 50 years. Prison reform for minorities. Lowest minority unemployment ever. Trade deals with China, Mexico, and Canada that will create high paying jobs for Americans. Great economy until this virus, but your the economics genius.

Greece has record unemployment in Europe. This is directly caused by failed leadership and society that works less and takes govt subsidies- Germany is the oppositeof greece. Greece's problems are not caused by immigrants. https://twitter.com/RT_com/status/1236754814597464070 …
I’ll be honest I don’t understand why anyone gives a fuck about unemployment rate half the reason it’s down isn’t him it’s the raise in pay from retail. But I’ve literally never had a problem getting a job ever. So why moan about it and the people moaning are the ones in the -
Today, black unemployment is HALF what it was under the previous admin. It is the lowest since measuring began. Elect Sanders & his brand of socialism, & those gains disappear.

Personal leave can be long with a doctor's signature and would prolly qualify for state unemployment compensation. What exactly are vacation days in an institution that for profs is only open 9 months a year?
It's not by TRUMP'S dumbass that unemployment has been reduced, he's only for the corporation's that's been willing to pay him
Why is it important .... is it the thriving economy or the low unemployment rate in inercity community’s that we need we need gone?
Such crowds do not necessarily translate to votes....due to high unemployment, it's very easy for any politician to pull a crowd.
President Obama brought unemployment down from 10% to 4.5% Thats a 5.5% drop and boost to the economy. Trump road President Obama's wave of economic growth to 3.5% That's a 1% drop. He hasn't gone below 3.5%. President Obama handed Trump a fantastic economy.

Many states still have high unemployment
It didnt work because they are states. Not countries. All the Northern European countries do it just fine. Even some western European ones. We have high work participation. Only a 3% unemployment rate and more population means more taxes to accommodate higher population

@ realDonaldTrump this why you don’t base your success as POTUS based on the stock market. You look stupid. Really really stupid. And that’s hard to do as you because you’re you.
Can't help but notice that the same people denying climate change are also denying Corona. Notice how the stock market doesn't care what you think, and reacts to reality? This is a cold, not a killer bug, not a famine, not a water shortage- the real problems are yet to come.
Markets are going to be brutal tomorrow morning. Hopefully my bitcoin gainz offset my stock losses I bought into last week thinking I was buying the dip.

If you’re someone who is about to retire this year, a crashing stock market sucks. As a young person with 30 years before I retire, a crashing stock market is a win. Buying shares at a lower rate instead of at historic/inflated record-highs is much better in the long run.

The economy and the stock market are not the same.
So you've been in a coma since 2008? The stock market is a total fraud, propped up by the free money the Fed has been handing banks since '08 so they can buy stocks and take the economy private. Coronavirus is an excuse for deflating that bubble. This should be no surprise.
Is # COVID19 the Trojan horse of the stock market? So much irrational panic and fears in the air. # investing
Close the stock markets.

You'll have lots of time to watch the collapse of the Stock Market, Raphael ! check out oil prices...it is below 40 which signals a collapse of the stock markets. Trump is such a stable genius, isn't he??
Corona Virus? Indictments? Maybe just more stock market drops... Whatever... Just no stopping it.

His entire re-election pitch was “we have big numbers in the stock market and the economy’s doing well” if he loses that he doesn’t have much to run on. That plus the way he grew the economy puts us at risk of worse recessions doesn’t put him in a good position.

Coronavirus generates serious real shocks due to the decline in the demand for travel, and so forth. But how much less would the drop in the stock market have been if we knew that the President was at least being honest?
Why would lower oil prices drag down stock markets?

According to (never bias) Trump Adm: "USMCA will raise real U.S. GDP by $68.2 billion. Although this is positive, it is only 0.35% of the total GDP of the country." If true, hardly a game changer. GDP is growing at a ok 2.1%. I wait to comment further til we get a real China deal
Taxation can never suffice as a main source of revenue, not in this country. Since recession, we’ve averaged just over 2% GDP growth. There’s not enough output to generate enough revenue. Borrowing is inevitable, what we do with what we’re borrowing is the issue.

Oil crash is a massive bonanza for the Indian economy. We are talking about 60+ billion decline in oil import bill if prices stay here. That is 2% of GDP--a massive boost to profits in Levy-Kalecki terms. Plus downward pressure on inflation, allowing RBI to keep rates low.
The result was a manufacturing contraction in early 2016 that, while it did not translate into a broader recession, cut into the pace of GDP and jobs growth, and undercut corporate earnings. This "hidden recession" was one factor that may have helped elect Trump.

Energy use is so closely correlated with GDP, I'm pretty sure energy is the real basis of the economy. Fossil fuels are over 80% of global energy, to meet climate targets we must reduce energy use so we have spare capacity to manufacture more renewable generation.

A recession has a specific definition, from an economics perspective. And it IS possible to be in one before you know you are. The definition is two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. It’s possible we are in what will become the first quarter of the required two.

~6% of GDP? I doubt it. And the impact on GDP if they don't? We know Keynsian economics works. It is pure folly to ignore that in pursuit of an ideologically-driven 'balanced budget' at the very time they should be adding stimulus. And that ignores the cost of doing nothing
By definition can’t have one until the end of the second quarter of GDP falling.
So you want to change subjects from GDP. Ok. Trump has added more government jobs in three years than Obama did in eight. Obama created 7 million FULL TIME jobs in his last three years alone. As for the magic wand...Obama was right. Those jobs aren't back.
In the 2015-'16 war, according to @ Ed_Crooks, GDP growth shrunk by 1.3% from 2015 to 2016. 3/3

We have the highest incomes, highest gdp per capita, and lowest taxes in canada. Describing Canada's richest province as 'broke' is ludicrous and false. We choose not to tax. There's a profound difference between that and 'broke'. # ableg
Here’s that Obama gdp you’re using unrelated insignificant statistics to defend. https://www.newsmax.com/t/finance/article/946308?section=georgementz&keywords=obama-economy-taxes-regulation&year=2019&month=12&date=17&id=946308&oref=duckduckgo.com …
Remember, the recession occurred in 2016. We’ve had about 4 years or more to keep navigating to make the non-oil GDP drive the growth. It already constitutes over 90% of the GDP but we need it to grow and to grow quick
How is evolving the # taxes and # financial prospects of # Argentina? The country is heavily indebted, so the exports taxes are the main source to pay external debt. This data is crucial to understand GDP evolution, please click here: http://bit.ly/NewGovernmentTaxCollection …
College needs to be for all regardless of socioeconomic background otherwise America will lack the skilled workforce it needs. By spending more GDP on allowing anyone and everyone to become a skilled member of the workforce we make the country better for everyone.
So, I'll ask again, what are your arguments for mass immigration, beyond good food and gdp? Gdp that never seems to reach the bottom btw. I actually want a genuine benefit it brings.
The GDP witnessed the best surge in Q4 2019 Guess what was the key driver? The oil GDP was the driver. The oil production stabilized at 2 Mbpd and the price of oil was above $50 With a dip in crude oil price that steeping growth we’ve been seeing will dissipate

GDP was a metric invented by socialists to excuse the non-recovery during the Great Depression. No serious libertarian uses that metric.
Thankfully, the French Parliament has great healthcare. America, the country with the highest GDP per capita, is forcing people with corona symptoms to go back to work or risk losing their jobs. We need an economy that works for people not people working for the economy. https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1235840055895134208 …
Just imagine how much debt the treasury can issue and then refinance at these rates. We can add 3 trillion more in debt and still keep the debt service at the current % of gdp.

Where are these prosperous trade deals? The govt’s own figures suggest that leaving the EU single market and customs union would cost between 4.5% - 7.5% of GDP whereas their own figures suggest that the best deal with the US would be worth 0.16% of GDP.
Worth very roughly about $70 trillion based on usual actuarial figures; would be arguably less spread worldwide as many countries have much lower values for a saved human life just by having much lower GDP, thus life-saving measures are cheaper. Eventually quarantine costs more.
Oh Dear, the Barnet Formula does NOT have anything to do with the Budget set by WM, it’s a fixed % age of the UK’s GDP from the proceeding year....
Both of which have little to do with the economy, well the latter one actually is a super high positive for economic growth of course. You'd expect GDP growth this year to beat estimates by around 0.5% or higher with $30 oil.
And yet, Norway is the 3rd happiest country in the world. India? A pathetic #140. All that gdp that the elite horde at the top. pic.twitter.com/zqT5YNmWvY
Are you saying the Fed's not doing enough? @ NickTimiraos Soon everybody will be able to stay home by choice, Fed keep printing money and will boast nobody needing to work but a steady multi-year trend of 2-3% GDP.

Norway is in the global top 7 exporters of crude oil. The oil and gas sector constitutes around 18% of Norwegian GDP and 62% of Norwegian exports in 2018. Norway is Western Europe's most important source of natural gas. Oslo Oslo.... we have a problem
Also USD has US GDP value which can be measured. Bitcoin has pure emotion based supply/demand without any construct.
Energy is 8% of total GDP and a major employer of US workers. All’s well that ends well. $ SPY $ OILhttps://twitter.com/MarketWatch/status/1236780406323793924 …
Would be very concerned about the Texas economy but would also caution that energy sector is highly capital-intensive which more directly affects Texas GDP. Remains to be seen how profound the impact will be on Texas employment, which is far more diversified.

This ep was tough - strongly agree w open immigration yet my soul hurt hearing the logic around economic growth tethered to the fiction of “Rich” vs “Poor” + its darkest chapter, GDP. Would like to propose a Reality Turing Test. Glad I listened, appreciate the challenge.

Let’s see what happens in the next couple of weeks. We will know more after that. Plus the market is tanking and the economy is probably headed for a recession. Things are not good for Trump right now. He will be red 2 out if his 4 years in the market and GDP will fall under 2%
It's about Nation gdp per capita
Oil, gas , mineral extraction and quarrying make up for 8 percent of Canadian GDP. Not unimportant, but not exactly the sole driver of the Canadian economy.

Look around you, people. Your own eyes should give you SOME idea of promises made, promises kept. What is Biden going to do, slapping anti-business restrictions on this economy and hitting the brakes to stop improvement? Obama BOASTED a 1% GDP growth; Trump’s GDP is close to 4%!
"GDP: the final frontier. To mathematically go where no one has gone before". Beam me up, Scottie.

The US running a $500B current acct deficit with >100% of that CA deficit from the (unproductive) govt sector & with a Net Int'l Investment Position of -55% of GDP means that the US does not have productive capacity on net, with the USD valued as it is v. other fiat currencies.
For starters, how much of GDP is from oil production?
Everyone had higher GDP then china 20 years ago. It wasn’t until China employed free market ideaogy that it helped lift 350 million out of abject poverty.

We’re paying an increasing portion of GDP to weather-related disasters in recent years, partly because of climate change.

The Resistance has done more harm to political institutions in this country by spreading the idea that a country with a GDP lower than New York state’s is able to mind control American citizens by buying Facebook ads & running a botnet out of a St. Petersburg office park

I understand a balanced budget & I understand the whole GDP thing, I simply think they need to work a bit harder at reducing that 750B dollars we owe. It'll bite us in the ass sooner or later. Hard times always follow good times. Discomfort now or Pain later.
If you think tens of millions of people, at least 5% of the gdp, only constitute a “micro” economy ... go in peace.
