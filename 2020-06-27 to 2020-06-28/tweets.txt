President Trump followed the science which said to shut down the economy. Blaming President Trump for the vote is ridiculous. Any sane person can see that.
Clinton had a Republican Congress that he worked with and Dodd/Frank provided by Democrats, is what crashed the economy. If Trump inherited the economy, then why did obama say 1% GDP was the new norm, jobs aren't coming back and blamed Bush his entire presidency?

You’re aware that Bernie has a massive fund raiser right before he dropped out, right? Knew he was leaving the race, kept the money. There has been no abuse of power from Trump. Just fake reports because the Dems can’t stand the good economy that they said he would crash.
..yes, all of this is expensive and hurts but all of it generates more in the future, it's called investing. All you have to do is look at the track record of Repub presidents and the effect they have had on the economy since the 80's till now and compare it to Dem presidents.
Kevin, PAY ATTENTION HERE. Why do we need to rebuild the economy?? Because Trump led us into the fastest, steepest recession in HISTORY.
No I know about the bill he’s try to pass that will make the economy drop
They did a half-shutdown so they tanked the economy and destroyed businesses AND reopened so fast that the pandemic never stopped. They somehow managed to do everything so badly that we're in like, a worst-case scenario
We need from trump 1. A vision for 4 years what are you going to do for us? 2. Show empathy to racial issues & covid - offer hope 3. Get a new VP @ SenatorTimScott to help unify & relieve racial tensions 4. Speak to law/order mob issue 5. Give us hope for economy

You’re a sick, pathetic, scared old man. Whatever crime you think this man committed, you think it’s going to distract us from the 128,000 dead from COVID? Our troops in Afghanistan, sold out by their commander in chief? The tanking economy? Police brutality?

Cuts are a political choice, which drag down any chance of economic recovery in a recession. Australia escaped the 2008 crisis by investing, where other countries like the UK pursued aggressive cuts and still have not recovered. Austerity = a false economy.

Well Biden, of course. He along with President Obama changed the direction the economy was heading. He will know how to get us out again. His track record is solid. The tanking of the economy falls on the inept response to Covid. Sit down.

Right, but my point is twofold. One, unless we’re closing down other parts of the economy again, then you’re exempting younger and healthier people from a risk that you’re literally asking everyone else to take. Two, the players who are concerned should absolutely not be forced
The economy is in the toilet with over 47 million unemployed, we have a pandemic which has killed over 125,000 Americans, and Trump is tweeting wanted posters. He is insane.
Anything to stop the economy! That's all they have left, nothing else worked. I hope the American people don't fall for it. The protests are the reason for the rise in covid19 positive people.

Hello America and the world. This is what @ realDonaldTrump is spending his time doing instead of rebuilding the economy, reducing COVID infections and getting the country back on track. Like Nero playing the fiddle while Rome burns.
It's a very apt stat, you're assuming seven plus billion would get infected by Covid19, not likely. Also not worth shutting down a multi-trillion dollar economy for such a low mortality rate.

No he didn’t, it wasn’t until the tax cuts that the economy took off. It’s proven when the top tax rate exceeds 38% the economy will not grow. During times where it’s above 38% the Economy can’t grow without the government pumping money into it.

Thus, to get the economy going again on a capitalist basis, value production must expand. I've previously written about how this must happen, so I won't go over old ground. The important point is this: changing the quantity of money is not changing the quantity of value.

On the futility of quantitative easing, which cannot be understood without a labour theory of value. Why is it that all that extra liquidity into the banks does nothing to revive the economy? It comes down to what money is.
Gold can't replace the dollar, hyperinflation works the same for gold, silver, platinum as it for the dollar. Anything that use to represent your economy can be hyperinflated to make worthless. Hyperinflation destroys all economies & http://civilizations.It 's happened before.
Then our economy can only COLLAPSE. If taxes are raised that much, people will not be able to spend. If people have no money to spend due to high taxes, how can anyone make money in order to pay taxes on making that money?

He not dumb but he doesn’t focus on that part of the job Judges An the economy
1. Trump inherited a robust economy from Obama 2. Trump boosted the economy further by cutting taxes for the wealthy and corporations resulting in investing their additional wealth in the stock market, stripping enviro and banking regulations.
Brexit will cause more serious decline in the economy which will mean significantly less real incomes and a much lower standard of living for most British people - There is no doubt about this.

Haha so it’s not overly dramatic to get hysterical about a statue being pulled down being the end of America ... but it is when thousands of people are dying and the economy suffering because a large segment of the population is brainwashed into not wearing a mask

You'll also find that every party if they got into government would have to abandon their manifesto. Due to the changed circumstances of the economy. SF doesn't want to be in power during a recession.
They want the economy to fail, they want the covid numbers exaggerated and they want people to lose interest in Trump so they can cheat like Hillary did but this election they want to win. The Dems have not forgotten Hillary cheated and lost.
Risk was Democrats would replace Biden if Trump tanked due to economic collapse that could occur from lockdown. (Trump job approval on economy did collapse). But Democrats did not dump Biden, so that puts Trump back in the driver's seat. Dems best chance is still replacing Biden.

As most people who get it still experience it as the worst flu they'v ever had, further impinging on their ability to be with the family or contribute to the economy (for weeks or months), I'd say cases are a pretty important number.
You know what's ridiculous? Vaccine's gonna come out, and the first people to get it will be kids and old Boomers. The GenXers actually driving the economy and taking care of the others while doing it will be last in line.
You’re losing...total failure in managing pandemic, resulting in collapsed economy, and stoking the systemic racism that Americans don’t tolerate anymore...your place in history is already documented- the worst president in US history- congrats
We shall indeed. His "efforts " include ignoring guidance HIS OWN team has put out. In fact the current spike is likely to grow exponentially in the next few weeks...and that will further damage the economy.

Cognitive dissonance. Trump hasn’t saved us, Covid isn’t down to zero, terrible unemployment, and he is a traitor and a fraud. God bless, ma’am.
States don't have the funds to supplement unemployment, so they'll open up to ease the burden. People who can find work will. Many won't though since many companies have closed/downsized. This plus a spike in cases will lead to half-hearted shutdowns. Repeat till spring.
What kind of BS are you spewing? We have record unemployment, COVID spiking, Trump letting Russia put bounties on American troops, and cops wanting to incite a race war. You need to get it together.
If you test positive yes you get unemployment for 2weeks
Sure would like to see you concentrate on other issues that are just as important like unemployment benefits voting locations and Breanna Traylor police reform stop the photo OPs king Andy the incompetent
Bet you never once praised him for the economy the lowest unemployment rate More black Americans employed in history. Covid 19 who the f... was prepared for that ?.They still don't know much. Anyway whatever Trump did or didn't do you would find fault.

@ realDonaldTrump it’s not true that artist, freelance worker feel a disincentive to work due to unemployment benefits. Any of us would take the jobs in a heartbeat if the jobs were available. These are our passions and Sanity. jobs are sparse. Please continue 600.00 passed July.
You’re missing the Big Picture, namely that Barry had 8 yrs to manage the country & yet there was no significant improvement in any vital area but lots of downward molbility in most. The unemployment & economic realities are that the USA was headed into the crapper as he planned.
So extend unemployment. This isn't hard. How did you avoid thinking of that? Was it intentional?

Do you realize if trump allows the post office to fail the fallout. It would add 600000 to unemployment to the ranks. Then you have those business using the post office in order to conduct business.
How about the best economy ever, lowest unemployment rate ever, highest stock market ever just to name a few!!!
Sadly Sir, the bulk of the people that you are talking about have zilch interest in the uplifting of their country men&women. From unemployment, illiteracy, religion, hardship of any shade, all are weaponized by the privileged few so that the majority remain beggarly.

Britain faces a second Covid disaster. Mass Unemployment & a collapse in tax revenues leading to a spending crunch. The British government will fund its way out of it by issuing more debt.

anybody who doesn't vote on a second stimulus check you all need to be voted out people like me have not lived off the perks of unemployment I've lived off 10 to 15hr a week and now my car broke down forcing me to have to walk 5 miles because I don't have another way around.
That must have been his strategy since day one, because the job growth was...oh...so....slow...one job at a time indeed...only 184K per month to Obama's 237K.

5) they haven’t! Democrat run cities and their policies have been in place for over 30 years. Yet these communities that have millions of dollars poured into them are filled with crime, blight unemployment and no opportunity. Black Lives Matter fundraising has garnered over-
Theirs no reason why they never froze rent, why people still haven’t received their stimulus check, why they never sent out another round of stimulus checks, why the unemployment website is so hard to use, why people refuse to wear a mask, I mean the list goes on & on
Uh, not fun at all! People like you that want to drive everyone out , is what's wrong with our country now. More unemployment! Fueling fires! These issues need to be investigated, addressed, talked about and decisions made. Not just the ax.

Yes! Youth unemployment is an unfolding tragedy So many will simply miss out on opportunities to be employed, gain skills & experience that would otherwise set them up for later years. This is the cost of Government failing to implement substantial stimulus # insiders

I think essential workers should get hazard pay but I also think that the extra $600 for people on unemployment is so important! I couldn’t afford to feed my babies and stay in our home without it and I can’t return to my job.

The campaign doesn't matter anymore now, John – no political campaign can distract from his actual job performance. This isn't an ordinary year – we have Great Depression-level unemployment because he shut the country down for a flu, and cities burning in insurrection. Wake up.
Unemployment rate is 13.3%.
History will blame Paulie here @ RepGosar's @ GOP for RECORD AMERICANS DEAD of # COVID19 Massive unemployment The brilliant Democratic economy Trump inherited in 2017 down the toilet. # RememberInNovember And # VoteThemAllOut2020
You forgot about another kind, like we have in the US. Most is capitalism, except the parts like unemployment and social security, medicare, disability benefits, stuff you may have been lucky (and young) enough to have avoided so far. Can you guarantee you'll never need these?
Honestly if they keep Parscale on I don’t think Trump would win. He just seems totally overwhelmed how to break the unemployment numbers and covid numbers to the American people and complete dissatisfaction and riots without “deal with it lol”

All by himself? Really? No growth during Obama’s 8 years? No decrease in unemployment? Really?
I actually had a discussion with a fellow in this thread and changed my mind on the inflation issue, but a result of a blanket policy would likely result in a rise in unemployment, at least until inflation catches up at its current rate. https://www.cbo.gov/publication/55410 …
I don't agree. He has succeeded in Zero GDP High Unemployment rate Losing Indian territory Making a fool of his followers High inflation Fake news Solt out Media and politicians. Divisiveness in unity. Blame game. Do you need more to measure ?? He is a successful PM
Trump is running against himself because he is his worst enemy: botched response to the pandemic w/126,000+ deaths, failed economy, total incompetence, horrible unemployment # s, taxes to the wealthy, corruption,etc..

So that’s a platform today? What about jobs? Job training? Healthcare? Taxes? Trade? Unemployment?
How do you afford that on unemployment? let me in on the secret!
my problem is i want unemployment while working
Unemployment was at record lows, but that's because of how it's counted - not to mention that most of the jobs are barely at poverty level subsistence. I'm far from a Biden guy, but we're rotting from the inside out. Trump is that on steroids.
I just finally got my unemployment money
Also to realise that youth unemployment needs a targeted response. Evidence shows stimulus alone does not assist youth u/e. Procurement process that prescribe targets for employing young people is one way that can work
If he wasn’t briefed there are one helluva lot of people who need to be in the unemployment line immediately. I don’t believe that was the case though, do you?
Man, those unemployment benefits PLUS the extra $600/week totally saved my drug habit.
Raging pandemic, massive unemployment, Russian bounties on the heads of American soldiers, and today he’s golfing. So what’s the plan? https://twitter.com/votealonzo/status/1276971841471385600 …
The budget didn't address the most important issues like unemployment. Due to Covid-19 there is more unemployment than ever before. Food prices have all gone up. It seems the government is not sure how to handle unemployment.
Is that so surprising? Most Americans got a huge injection of cash via the stimulus checks and a nice double dip with unemployment checks. The more interesting view is debt levels and changes in cash:debt ratio. I’m curious how they will change as COVID programs wind down...
“Abolish capitalism now” while they collect 1000 a week in unemployment
5.5% unemployment rated for African Americans lowest ever recorded, before the Democrats panicked & shuttered the US in hopes of winning in Nov. Obama's lowest 7.5% African American poverty level 20.8% lowest ever recorded. Arrests of AA, lowest on record. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52907646 …
Many of still have not received unemployment. What about rent due July 1st. Also my landlord says we have to enter a payment plan. I though we had a year to pay back without one.
You realize Biden had 44 yrs along with Pelosi and Obama and left a shit hole. How about # FirstStepAct, more money given to # HBCU than Ever before or how about lowest unemployment, highest stock market #’s ? These riots are ALL Democratic fueled. End.
I can’t wait until y’all mfs stop getting these unemployment checks so people who been bussing they asses this entire pandemic can purchase shit offline because y’all lazy asses been buying everything tf up
It isnt progress in that regard. And you're right, much more needs to be done. When our unemployment numbers were at record lies we were on track to doing just that before the new SARS hit But let's look at our Constitutional rights. They've all been upheld, right?
than they have been at any time over the past 15 years. Thus, Fed policies are failing to bring down unemployment while simultaneously inflating financial asset values. As such, they are having a profound effect on the distribution of wealth
Hope you enjoy your unemployment...it must be great being “woke”. And...nobody cares
America was great with the best economy and lowest unemployment seen in over 50 yrs. what corruption. Name it. Or do you count scandals like Obama does? With his eyes closed. The Russia collusion should shut your piehole and make take a pause
But people don’t want to get back to work, at least not while they get the extra $600. I had an ad on Craigslist for pool cleaning $18/hr. One applicant. $600 wk + unemployment = UBI. I think a lot of people will find a way to do with less consumption if they don’t have to work.

63,000 dead, country in meltdown, millions facing unemployment, NHS shattered, councils facing bankruptcy, Govt with a 6 point lead in polls, and you think a centrist establishment-backed Labour leader scoring 2 points above an inept Tory leader is a cause for celebration.
They need to do a stimulus and help -other- than unemployment for that very reason. Otherwise, unless you're already getting SSDI, it's "get infected and die or stay penniless and die". And of course they froze Sect 8-11 and SSDI case processing. This is a culling.
With recent announcements of upcoming state and local government layoffs the unemployment will increase over the next several weeks. Actual pool of jobs would provide an individual the luxury of planning a job as benefits decrease.

My husband received our stimulus check, yes. That’s the ONLY thing correct in your ridiculous comment. No unemployment check, we work from home, and I’m not black, but I am a democrat. So you can stop with your bigoted racial assumptions. You’re such a # TRUMP cliche.
I already told you. The Democrats did a good job rebranding themselves to get the black vote. Made lots of promises that were never fulfilled. Trump got us to lowest ever black unemployment. Created a boom in black small businesses by slashing unnecessary regulations. (cont)
Bro I applied for unemployment two months ago and never received my card till now and ended up with 4K in my account I’m SHOOK
also bold to assume that I had all of those things to begin with ... unemployment is currently at astronomical levels.
Prison reform, funding for HBCU, lowest unemployment for minorities, and opportunity zones... yes he is not good at being racist
Oregon plan of defense: default on all loans, moratorium on rent. State pays utilities. At some point it's ok to create a paper system while you crash the legacy system and rebuild unemployment payment systems. Old school new school, write the checks. @ OregonGovBrown
Yeah Obama. The guy who took stock market from 7K to 18K. Unemployment from 11% to 5. Insured more Americans thereby saving thousands of American lives. Ironically Trump is the exact opposite of a successful president
I wish the unemployment would be extended.
I have a friend that was filling out unemployment for her man and doing job searches for him

Some of y’all asses going to jail for unemployment fraud
Where were you at the beginning of the year when we had lowest unemployment in 50 years for Blacks, Women, Latinos, and Asian?
Your question has nothing to do with mine. Essesntially paying people unemployment to keep them off of the unemployment list doesn't make them employed. In other words, fudging numbers never works. Just ask Charles Ponzi.
125k+ Americans dead. Record high daily coronavirus cases. 13.3% unemployment rate. Russian agents placing bounties on the heads of our soldiers. And this is what you tweet about. Statues should be the least of your worries.
I wouldn't be able to pay rent and utilities with unemployment. I wouldn't be able to feed myself after paying rent. I wouldn't be able to afford gas after eating. Even in the best financial scenario I've ever been in, I don't have enough money to live independently.
Clean Power Plan, DACA, Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, Osama Bin Ladin killed, US Freedom Act, Tax Relief Unemployment Insurance, created more jobs than Bush DURING economic recovery after recession crash (under BUSH), negotiated with Iran to end nuclear weapons,...
Never got a stimulus or unemployment but been hustling since way before the quarantine, blesss a young artist
I think, based on Libby's actions as Mayor she should be rebranded # MayorKaren maybe then she will do something other than claim DJT is a racists. I means let's be honest who do you really want in power the guy that put minority unemployment or a Mayor that won't stop choke holds
You were so right,,,im so sick of winning,,,most covid deaths,,most covid infections,,most states seeing a massive resurgence of covid,,most protests,,most unemployment numbers,,most rounds of golf you played,,,most business having to reclose or close all together!!! of winning
Assuming @ DougJonesHQ dead. AL/MS/KY/SC/WV/TX/LA all safe R. But 3 huge unknowns. How bad pandemic? How bad economy/unemployment. If million dead. 20% unemployed/depression. R's failure & animus 4 science&govt could put Redsates in play. & tRmp=GeorgeWallace could backfire bigly.
If you cared half as much for the Americans dealing with # covid19 pandemic and unemployment. You should be barking at Putin who runs the @ WhiteHouse
I always forget unemployment is payed by your last employer that's genuinely sick
Incest and being on unemployment/disability.
I think the fact that the unemployment rate under Obama was much closer to the unemployment rate post Lockdown(or rather when we started reopening) under Trump than the pre Lockdown Unemployment rate really questions the narrative of: Obama was de best and Trump is de worst.
In the States, unemployment is somewhere around 16% and a most people who've lost their job also lost their healthcare. ...but NOT ONE member of the House or Senate has lost theirs. # JusSayin # SorryNotSorry # MyINFAMOUSLife # ImINFAMOUS # LetsBeINFAMOUSTogether # YerDoinItWrong
And it’s not just the # CoronavirusPandemic, there’s massive unemployment with many jobs not coming back & the CARES Act $600/wk ending on 7/25, he hasn’t addressed the # BLM movement or the police brutality that sparked it & now the Russian bounty on US troops in Afghanistan # Golf
I worked really hard for the last 3 years and I was slipping into debt. Then Covid hit and somehow the government finally paid me what they owed me with unemployment money. Now I have a lot of it saved up (First time I've been able to save in 6 years) but it's still not enough.
when unemployment end ?
You've got cause and effect the wrong way round. Lab in gov loses elections when unemployment rises. Lab wins them in gov when it's steady or lower. Hence it won three elections from 97-05, (whatever the flaws of the NL), in 66 etc
WHY IS MARYLAND ONLY COUNTING WORK THROUGH SEPT 2019 FOR 2020 UNEMPLOYMENT???????????? pic.twitter.com/Pm1uExeCvG
That's what I'm talking about! Confidence in who you are is what I feel about myself too! Things are really good, staying busy in construction, no union, no boss except me, no unemployment income needed either! Good for YOU!
10% unemployment would be a great outcome since last month was really 16
Anyone else file for unemployment in NJ? How long did it take? I'm on week 5. When I check my status online it says "Pending". Anyone else have a similar experience?
No more unemployment over payment! I’ve worked my entire life and have through this mess and now you can sit at home and collect 1k a week?
To incentives the hiring of unskilled/new workers into work force. Which will help the black teenage unemployment numbers (which Trump was doing a good job with before covid). Also ending the Drug war would help defund gangs and create less of a need for cops. Which I think is

@ OregonGovBrown I applied for unemployment and PUA in April and still nothing. I am out of work by no fault of my own. The unemployment office is a joke. Something needs to be done!
Right. Like damn bruh you sent enough people to unemployment
Trump is running against himself because he is his worst enemy: botched response to the pandemic w/126,000+ deaths, failed economy, total incompetence, horrible unemployment # s, taxes to the wealthy, corruption,etc..
Yep, strange how unemployment is high everywhere yet the high crime only touches certain cities ran by certain people.
I'm not sure if anyone reads these comments, but here we go again. Don't know why there is a question that anyone making under 50,000 a year shouldn't get a stimulus check. The people who need it the most isn't only unemployment recipients They get 600 a week plus whatever the

Extending the unemployment $600/week would make a world of difference to the 100s of immigrant, female, black and brown staff @ RutgersU decided to furlough through the end of the year.

Yeah, I guess the whole, highest unemployment rate since the Great Depression thing just kind of missed him.
I was decent til mfs cut off my unemployment g lol, talmbout I quit
What did you expect regarding unemployment? People need to go back to work now or businesses will fold. I’d end furlough now.
And yet Pennsylvania is still a swing state??? Trump means jobs and work. "Green New Deal Joe" means unemployment and welfare. How is this even close??? https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1276982635676553218 …
get a grip. Corbyns ‘few’ was this country’s many. Conservatives help everyone. Less poverty. More children in good and excellent schools. Wages rising above inflation. Record low unemployment. Infrastructure investment. Green transport like hs2. Green energy skyrocketing....
I kind of get that. My son has two former coworkers who refuse to go back to work because unemployment is easy and pays better. His employer has trouble staying staffed now, no one wants a good job with benefits?
Haha you didn't say this when he had the Lowest unemployment numbers in history. Sit down & tell your wife you need to see a neurologist.

I’m more interested in him protecting our troops from Russian bounties, Americans from a deadly disease, massive unemployment, keeping good relations with our allies and protecting and defending the Constitution. I don’t really care about grandstanding over statues.
It’s his way of telling everyone not to come here because America has the highest covid cases and a 13% unemployment rate.
How & why do you feel that is the case? He has brought back jobs, created tax cuts fro the middle class, lowered the unemployment rate of Blacks/Hispanics/Others, has gotten them all a raise in pay. Supported more Black Colleges & canceled out the Clinton/Biden Crime bill. We are
You know how many people haven't received anything from unemployment since applying 3 months ago? But they want you arguing like animals over who should get what
Sad state. The covid cases never flattened at all. It rising as fast as the unemployment and poverty incidents. Comparing to our asian neighbors, we were the worst in all metrics.

What economy? Do you mean the one that has over 60 million people out of work, the one where thousands of businesses had to permanently close or file bankrupt or the one where people have to sit in cars in long lines at food banks or stand in long lines to apply for unemployment?

idk bruh there’s jobs out there that pay more, literally the amount of an unemployment check a week
First of all, the boom started under Obama. Second, 120k plus dead. Third we are at 13% unemployment. If you consider that leadership, it's no wonder Republicans elect shit leaders to positions of power. Looks like another Democrat is needed to clean up this mess.
I’d agree with improving public schools because we are paying the price now with so many adults lacking critical thinking (among other) skills. With high unemployment, it’s an opportune time to attract bright students to teaching. I was responding to Matt’s post.
Why arw you talking and care about polls you poor excuse of a demented senior? You should be caring and talking about soldiers, citizens, unemployment, pandemia! You need a medical check up
Low unemployment?? Have you seen the # s? trump’s response was to lie, deflect, and golf all of February and half of March. Some response. US is worse than all of Europe because of mask clueless, like you. Trickle-down economics hasn’t worked, been proven before.
OMFG. Some of these are utterly ridiculous - Hispanic unemployment v. Hispanic Youth unemployment? Imagine if CNN used this scrutiny on Trump. I guess there wouldn’t be enough space online
not extending unemployment benefits is a death sentence on a lot of people EVEN those who are taking care of themselves

I’m just right I’m back at work making shit money again, that unemployment literally got me a house
They also do terrible macro econ reporting. They were so giddy after the unemployment numbers for last month came up at 13%. “So the recovery came early...” meanwhile every macro econ fellow was shouting about how this is not even close to a recover.
I love @ BernieSanders, but he is a coward for not using his influence to push a # RentStrike and a # TaxStrike. Money is the only thing the government and upper class value. We must make them care about police tyranny, # COVID deaths, and mass unemployment.
You need to be on it, since you think its so great!!!! I'm sure you can afford the 6k deductible. Affordable is a joke. It took Unemployment filed MAY 5th to JUNE 26TH to give me notice that unemployment healthcare will begin JULY17th, 2 1/2months later, SMH.

How am I triggered? Your basing the handeling of a pandemic on how we should look at a country. When In reality (a place you clearly don’t go often) you should judge it on systemic issues for instance economics and unemployment we have the highest gdp and the lowest unemployment.

Although many are making more currently on unemployment, that strategy is very short-term thinking. To the members of society that are out exploring job opportunities it will pay off.
Come in with Army and wipe out these loser rioters. We will rid the unemployment numbers by a few hundred thousand

That’s it? She misspoke? Trump is ignoring Russian bounty’s on US soldiers 125,000 dead from botched Covid-19 response Tear gassed citizens Unemployment at 14.6% Wow, you’re shameless...or a complete sellout, right?
Thanks for the education on the unemployment system. If it weren’t a problem, employers wouldn’t be asked to report these employees to the state.
Qustion: are those who lost jobs in 2019 or early 20 whose benefit has run out but are still jobless counted-Im guessing not. Are they also overlooked in terms of not being counted in unemployment numbers,...
Goldman Sachs now predicts,U.S. economy will drop 34% in 2nd quarter-Coronavirus job losses in the United States could hit 47 million,with unemployment at more than 30 per cent,according to stark new estimates by a Federal Reserve(DSP:LETS PRAY THESE R OVER THE TOP-BUT POSSIBLE)
We will make sure they make it. But the economic devastation has to be measured with people like this in mind. They are not on the unemployment rolls but they are suffering.
there was already low unemployment. widespread effects of the tcja couldn’t take hold instantaneously. it takes time with systems that large. Obama’s economy was hard-charging. he should get credit where it lies.

Obama cut unemployment from 10% to 4.8. Trump went from 4.8 to 3.6 and wanted a cookie. Most importantly, life expectancy for black people went up for the first time in 40 years, under Obama. It's on its way back down under Trump. He's shortening lives.
He is right but the sheep in the comment section want to be on lockdown & wear mask because they enjoyed those unemployment checks .
Nobody on unemployment is signing up for Obamacare, they can’t afford it. Stop lying!

Job wise. I have been highly concerned about unemployment the past few yrs. We need jobs now. It will take time to sort out provincial, federal, & global issues with O&G. All I see right now is chasing away any potential investor other than the US. & US only if Trump re elected.

Obamacare sucks - many people were never able to “keep their doctor”. They had failed on so many levels. How about the lowest unemployment rate in US history. The lowest black unemployment rate in US history. The least about of people on welfare in US history. Securing our border
LOL Tough times fam. Yet people out here spending that 1200 a week unemployment money like they earning it themselves. Draftkings posted a 30% revenue increase since pandemic hit. The “usual suspects” that bet on mobile app, are still betting
It's a damning indictment for humanity overall. Having small minded capitalists in charge, whom are only concerned about their money and the economy for the corporates and business class, represents vast challenges for so many. We are facing 30% unemployment everywhere by Sept.

The GOP voted largely against said bailouts. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Economic_Stabilization_Act_of_2008 … And what things do you feek are better? Don't you think that America has hit a historic low with unemployment, 100k deaths, and riots?
Balance risks. 1. Open economy too late, we have a sluggish economic recovery, increased unemployment lose more money. 2. Open economy too soon, we have increased infection and lose more lives. Our state and federal leaders erred on the side of money, not human life. # COVID
Corruption shouldn't be a Global Concern. Leaders should now when to stop or leave Office.

$600 per week is $2400/month. That wouldn’t even cover my mortgage. In some cities, rent on a 2-bd is more than that. If anyone is making more on unemployment than they are working, the proper response is to increase the minimum wage and consider a guaranteed income.

Well, we can't all be in the bunker like Trump. If you're referring to COVID, that's why you don't say "is hitting record low unemployment rates". If you want to say "had hit", that's fine. But "is hitting" is present tense, and presently, he's certainly not hitting record lows.

It’s not Trump who released the virus, destroyed economy and caused unemployment to rise. Those that caused this were counting on sheep like you to blame him to try to keep him from getting re-elected. Their plan obviously worked surprisingly.
Trump is running against himself because he is his worst enemy: botched response to the pandemic w/126,000+ deaths, failed economy, total incompetence, horrible unemployment # s, taxes to the wealthy, corruption,etc..
@ GovInslee hey gov, what about extending the job search for unemployment benefits? If the counties can’t progress into phase 3 or 4 then how can we find a job if companies can’t get back to normal? Just impossible governor Inslee:(
@ realDonaldTrump Democrats have a stranglehold on our economy. They're trying to destroy our middle class by limiting small businesses in the amount of customers they can have. They're increasing unemployment numbers by doing this.
Just listening to boss new Uniform promo and giving away my unemployment benefits to various charities on a humid Sunday evening.
I’m dealing with the same shit. I can pay my bills with my job but I can’t find a better one because nobody’s hiring with the COVID situation. Most people I know are on unemployment. But I’m stuck working and barely making anything off of it. It really sucks.
Facts don't lie? Okay. Current unemployment rate in May was 13.3 percent. This is, factually, not a record low.
I know of a place where staff doesn’t even have masks on location. And wait staff not on books which means they didn’t get unemployment nor the $600. They barely made it by financially only to be working again unprotected and still off the books. In the city limits btw.

You all need to get in there & a stimulus check because not all of us are lucky enough to live off of unemployment not all of us are lucky enough to have your salaries my car broke down I'm 51 years old now I have to walk 5 miles one way to work can you do that I doubt it.
Promising?! How sir? There are people still waiting on unemployment benefits that they were approved for!!!! It's going on 13 weeks for me! Without any payments! So when they say promising, what exactly do they mean? Stop already with the propaganda and lies!!!!

dude if we can do it and start flattening the curve... im sure you can too :D i get the whole Business stuff. but hey, i work from home... there are LOTS of companies who are actually shutting their doors down and moving strictly to working from home. saves on rent and such costs
Shutting down a whole business is kind of unfair for the workers there.The resturant or whatever it is lol can get sued, learn from their mistake and punish whoever is responsible.Remember if they continue on their business you have the choice to either support or cut them off.
Kinda messed up the way he ordered bars to stop serving booze instead of shutting them down. Seems like it neuters their ability to do business without offering them any safety net
I understand you’re attempting to dunk on me, but do you realize that the government is doing all of those things by shutting down automobile traffic and creating more outdoor space for businesses? Banning cars is helping every business on this street.
Target isn't necessary, it's a massive corporation that has bulk ownership the way walmart does and undercuts any small and local competitors in myriad types of businesses, the fact that it's shutting down stores means those locations can be replaced with local business
Y'ALL GOT BORED WITH COVID-19 WELL I'M BORED OF Y'ALL. I'M GOING HOME. SHUTTING DOWN MY BUSINESS.
I agree. How is shutting down the bars different from shutting down the restaurants with full bars? You see, the restaurants are still OPEN for business, but the bars were forced to close.

yes I have seen small business fail but never due to the government shutting them down and refusing to open them back up.
@ GovAbbott What are we doing? Death rate in my county .00004/infection rate .002. Close to herd immunity. Shutting down again!, with new restrictions. Gonna crush business, that were opening up and churches. Thanks media. While death rates this year vs last year are same. # Dumb.
Your attitude is why all our business are remaining closed and close to shutting down again
The minute a mask-mandate is put in place, public health has the ability to enforce the law by shutting down any business that does not comply. This, in and of itself, ensures mass compliance. Making mandates indoor-only also decreases the number of law enforcement interactions
If you're arguing that having to wear a mask in a public place is a violation of your liberty, but that shutting down your business and banning ppl from getting hip replacements or shoulder surgeries isn't, ok. If you really wanna play that game, go right on ahead.

That logic could be applied to any business. Your restaurant, for example. The burden of proof is on gov’t if gov’t is shutting down places.

Also blame the department of transport DfT when it came to screening passangers. Until almost last moment we had literally no screening anywhere in UK airports. While europe and US was shutting down we had airports running as business as usual. Easy to simply pass blame.

Absolutely. I don’t think paper magic should be happening in stores at all at this point but I also get that a lot of them are business skating on the edge of just shutting down. It’s a tough nut to crack.
Please tell us why this virus is more dangerous in bars than any other place. Shutting down one type of business is discriminatory. The fact that churches and restaurants are exempt (places where people open and close their mouths constantly) proves the absurdity.
Nope.I’m saying the virus isn’t going anywhere and the answer isn’t shutting down America. We have to learn to live with it until there is a vaccine. Ruining business owners lives and destroying the economy is not the answer.However the protests clearly played a part in the spike

Any business that claims they "sanitize" their business daily is pandering to you. First of all, its not possible to "sanitize" a business without shutting it down and going top to bottom. Second it doesnt do any good and wont protect you from Covid,

Shutting down small businesses, such as bars and other gathering places, and beaches does not stop the spread of covid19. People are social so they will meet up somewhere. It plays a role in closing the business for good though.
Apologize?!? @ GregAbbott_TX ?His only regret is opening bars too soon, not lambasting @ JudgeClayJ for his scientific approach to shutting down business. @ tedcruz is as much to blame as well for getting his hair cut from a GOP operative instead of sheltering place. # turnTexasblue

Microsoft shut down Mixer because it couldn't hold up to other streaming sites like Twitch and YouTube, it really had nothing to do with the Xbox division, if anything it's a good business move as money was being wasted and I applaud them for shutting it down when they did.

Shutting down a business isn't a solution. If other businesses are running then why not beauty saloons? # reopenkhisalons
Just gonna keep shutting down and reopening a myriad of business types until we find the steady state of keeping hospitals just at capacity and the economy running on 2 out of 4 cylinders I suppose
Dead wrong. A Karen would be taking pic of people without masks on with the sole purpose of shutting the business down because yoU'Re killiNg GraNDma
Can’t have it both ways. Can’t Blame President when he was the one who took early action shutting down travel from China, when the “experts” a month later are telling the public to go about their business. China and Complicit WHO are to Blame
John, as a profitable bulk agricultural commodity producer have you considered shutting down your business because you don’t offer a point of difference for consumers?
Then you are just known for travelling the globe wearing a trademark scarf with the colours of the Zimbabwean flag saying the country was open for business. Open for business, my foot. You halt business by shutting down the bourse and mobile money You have failed. Period.
Reverse what big business got and what the general population got in terms of federal relief ($) and we could have gone a lot harder on shutting down without hurting small business and regular people.
I am not equipped to answer that, though I have close friends who are business owners deeply concerned about their businesses' chances for survival. I am not a proponent of shutting businesses down again. I support masks and proper distancing to protect our fellow citizens.
Noone elected u 2 be their daddy. People know how to take care of their own health and don't need you acting like a tyrannical demoKKKrat by shutting down businesses. Stay in your lane and mind your business. Btw- read our Constitution It's not your place to control pplz health
Better check on Florida... they are shutting down again... so people will not be working and losing their business!! All because the American are used as pawns by the Democrats? Not right ... we are sick of it !!!
So why is Abbott not shutting down protesting? Instead he wants to punish business owners.

You would think conservatives would understand, wearing masks equates to reducing the chance of shutting down the economy. They claim to care for small business and blue collar workers, yet every decision that is not backed by the data is a spit in their face # GOPBetrayedAmerica

And @ GovSisolak bullied all business owners with the threat of shutting them down if they didn’t require his personal preference and more devisive behavior encourages folks to rat folks out. Not considering much those who medically cannot. That’s discrimination and a hate crime!
Come together.... You are wasting more $ and disregarding the Governor. Do your part and stop wasting money and stop shutting down business.
From Scottsdale @ MayorJimLane in regards to Old Town clubs voluntarily shutting down. “....As for those bars voluntarily shutting their doors, I wholly support any business that is making tough decisions for the sake of our overall community health.”
Please consider shutting the counties who's numbers are rising. As someone who is getting ready to go back to work in a county that's going crazy, I wish it would be stopped. If I don't go back when everyone opens, I lose my business. Wish it wasn't under my control.
Effectively shutting most business down.
Small businesses in Florida and around our country are DYING! Right after the bars opened up after a long hiatus, they're shutting them back down. I SUPPORT small business! # Floridacoronavirus # Naples # FortMyers # FL19
Why why why. I dont drink but shutting any business down is bull shit so why dont you just stay home if your that worried about it
It’s all arbitrary. “Safety” there are all sorts of exceptions. Bars in restaurants vs standalone etc. 50% capacity mask off. What? This makes no sense. The government has to prove a safety issue specific to shutting a business not make one up. Why isn’t public transit shut down?
But that's my point, many businesses currently need injections to be kept afloat. Thousands of profitable businesses that add to GDP could go. Why treats those of 'the arts' special?

Not a bad idea. Let's establish a government operating rate based on GDP. No more taxes but govt operates at xx% of GDP. Each sector of government is assigned a %. Instead of voting to give more money to x or y part of govt then you have to move money from x to y.

With lower GDP due to COVID, the only way the GOP can pay for their tax cuts is w $ from Social Security & Medicare. Why? That's where the money is. Trump promised this. With smaller middle-class than the past 40 yrs, we are facing a severe class divide.
The answer to that question: why do you need the state to care about you? Would cost more than the GDP of the US in therapy sessions
U.K. creative industries give a 4x return on public subsidy through tax revenue receipts. And it’s a major contributor to GDP. The U.K. publishing industry, for eg, is bigger by GDP contribution and employment than the fishing industry. So consider it speculating to accumulate.

GDP shrank by 5%; that's not building the economy; adding 1 trillion debt in a few months is not building the economy; printing money like we have never done before is not building the economy.
A fair question. Djibouti has recently been reclassified from poor to low middle income. GDP per capita is $3082 and projected to increase steadily. Life expectancy is 69.16 years (about the same as Pakistan). All these figures are an improvement on pre independence data.
I've feared this for a while, because immunity to other coronaviruses generally doesn't last. We may need a vaccine shot every two months... Good business for private healthcare, though! Grow that GDP!

It doesn't have to be paid back Pete... it will never be paid back. It just needs to remain within manageable parameters compared to GDP. The assumption is that GDP will continue to rise to cover borrowing. You can't think of national debt like a personal loan. Its very complex.
You’re literally worried about a country with 1/10 the GDP of the US and totally don’t care about China. They’ve convinced you that China is not bad. They’ve convinced that a complete communist country is our trading friend. You’ll be speaking Chinese in 30 years

According to The China Macroeconomy Forum's report, the economy of China will grow by 2.5 percent, 6.5 percent and 7.5 percent year on year in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2020, respectively. For this year, China's annual GDP growth is likely to reach around 3 percent
You mentioned "Quality of Life". Not land mass, GDP or population size. The US is roughly ranked 15th, Canada 9th. I believe Switzerland is the champion. Just saying.

Wow I'm surprised you just admitted you're dumb. We're talking about the RATE OF GROWTH of the GDP, not the GDP raw numbers. If you are moving along at a MINUS 6% pace one year, and then the next year you are moving at a PLUS 3% rate, you have made a turnaround of +9%! Hello?

I was about to comment on your original tweet which equated GDP growth to jobs... And then this happened. Not all GDP growths are same as you rightly mention here. As economists you guys should encourage this understanding unlike your original tweet.
I think Mr Ssebunya you didn't attend the economics class. There is no way you have to show people development. Development is felt among the living standards of the people, health standards, economics that is their GDP. Go back and revise that. Roads don't mean dvt
The latter seems unambiguously correct to me (with the caveats that the gdp can be broadly useful most of the time, and that the enclosures can be considered to be a gain in efficiency (though I don't think the increase in GDP reflects this))

Lol. How does total dollar amount only thing that matters. We are significantly larger than any other country on the list aside from China. We obviously will spend more dollar wise. That’s why % gdp is what matters. You realize 5% of 1 billion is more than 10% of 1 million?

The country's GDP slipped to 3 while it was in 7.2 in 2014. That's why loan in 60 yrs was 5 billion on the country now 65 billion. This things doesn't leave any global impact & that's Y every border is being attacked. Bcz lies can't be called lies anymore

Estimated WORLD spending on military is cited at $1917 bn in 2019. The USA alone spends $732 bn. That means 38% of world's spending. However, USA spends around 3.4% of its GDP. The GDP is just really high. World's average is 2.2% GDP on military spending.

The BEA publishes annual "produced assets" data back to 1951. Since then, GDP has always equaled about 0.09 X residential assets + 0.44 X nonresidential assets. Also, think physically: a worker with no capital can't produce anything.

GDP has obviously contracted worldwide due to the Corona virus, can't blame Khan for that. We are borrowing to pay back loans taken by Nawaz and Zardari. Lastly Nawaz and PPP governments signed contracts to purchase power at the world's highest rated, we are still paying.
Basic comparison was wrong. Govt took price in dollars multiplied it with paki conversion rate. We don't have same currency value, per capita, purchasing power, gdp, indirect taxes etc. Comparing apples with bnanas

There is a reason for the public's pushback on immigration. GDP is a function of "produced assets," not labor. So, adding labor without adding capital just shifts income away from American workers and toward the owners of capital.
