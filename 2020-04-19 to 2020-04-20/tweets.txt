Also as for being pro-life, why have all his press briefings about the pandemic been about the economy and NOTHING on the loss of life? If he was pro-life that would be his main talking point. He is not pro-life, he’s pro-birth, there is a difference
@ POTUS is playing all in. he’s trading tens of thousands of lives for the sliver of hope that the economy will rebound enough before the election. then he can crown himself the great ‘saviour’.. again. otherwise, he has nothing.m to hang his hat on.

It's really rather simple. Globalization basically made us a service sector economy, where 72% of GDP is derived from consumer spending.... outsource the work and jobs? No money for consumer spending.....DUMB
Too many of you anti Fox crowd are very authoritarian and closed minded. There are many reasons not to destroy the economy in a total lockdown but yes safety is also an issue. You only see one side of the argument and are quick to dismiss the other side as idiots.
Donald trump wants to put the economy back on...it’s affecting his businesses as we know three of his big hotels with thousands of workers have been shutdown..his putting his own interest first before the American people interest.. I mean you have 746,379 cases with 41,379 death

Can the thinkers explain whether an economy is dependent on foreign investment or investment can be local?
Yes. People will need to let go of some attachments to what life was going to be like. The coronavirus unfortunately does not care about our economy.
It’s about the Economy. Governors are told by their Globalist handlers to stall to make sure our Economy dies.
I know and also bear in mind that we can’t revive the economy when it dies We no fit
Not at all. My bearish angle isn’t about the characteristics you mentioned- but rather about reality. The REAL ECONOMY is in peril right now- the market should reflect that- so that there isn’t the wealth gap. To our demise- fed $$$ go to market rather than to the real economy.

@ TeamTrump President Trump you have done incredible job with our economy but now we have the virus too http://contain.It really sucks too see that fake news does not recognize what China has done especially the dems.Are they in bed with China?
The only reason why the economy WAS doing good is because it was already put on track by @ BarackObama. Also, Trump had plenty of time to do something about all of this, and he decided to call it a “democratic hoax”. Now that’s an immature president if I’ve ever seen one.
We finally found a way of bringing life back to dead people. So now we’re in a position of bringing life back to the economy and same to dead people. Interesting times ahead...

Absolutely spot on! Does my nut these chutneys sticking their 50ps in! So obvious what they’ve done & why! yea we may have had more deaths due to it, but damaging the economy further will cause even more deaths anyway! You can’t win in these situations!
Yes, they want the money to spend it. But each do not agree on what to spend it on! One thinks their idea is better than the other one. That's why they put them in the bill when President Trump cannot refuse to sign it! Also to destroy the economy that he has built up.
The trigger for opening the economy should be a accurate and precise way to test for Corona virus. The virus is spreading less within given community. There are no new double infections that can be confirmed. Random sampling to continue.

I have answered. Fact is, if the only people getting COVID-19 were the people yelling about how it's all a bunch of nonsense and that the economy is more important than people's lives... I think most of us would be perfectly okay with that outcome. You get what you give, fam.
Also, where economic desperation will lead to some suicides, how many are really attributable to the lockdowns? The virus hurts the economy whether or not there's state mandated orders or not.
Hospitals are half empty. Looking at layoffs and pay cuts for staff. They need to open the economy back up and those at high risk stay home. The virus is everywhere already.... has been since last November
Many of us still love all of the human-centered economy (and the whole data-driven approach Yang popularized). We want to see it come to pass. Right now we have a massive chance with UBI in the face of the crisis so that’s what we are pushing hardest on.

I don’t trust government that much. Honestly, I don’t need their plan. But I’m all for the testing to be more widespread, but the economy can’t wait for certainty. This shutdown may have already caused a depression. Each state should decide what can open & start. NC is ready.

You Mister are a very confused man. You should be more worried about the lives of the american people and then if the economy falls you can rebuild it but you can bring the dead back to life. Think about that...
I do understand your point but trust me his decision is quite deadly. Let the economy fall to save life which is more valuable and irreplaceable. I'm devastated by his decision though.

No, I think it came from the less secure lab in Wuhan, not WIV. Then Xi didn't want Chinese economy to be the only one to suffer, so Beijing & Shanghai were isolated without lock down but no one coming in. Hence continued flights out of China. Levelled the playing field.
I understand the impact social distancing and stay-at-home orders are having on the economy. I've seen both friends and family impacted by it. But we can't open up the economy without more testing, contact tracing, etc. We need to know more about what we're dealing with.

I think there will be a massive rush to open up roads and keep widening them "to get the economy moving" because the UK authorities think roads and drivers are the only way. Sadly.

US stocks rose on Friday and also posted gains for the week, boosted by a surge in @ Boeing shares, President Donald Trump's plan to reopen the # coronavirus-battered economy and hopes of a potential drug by Gilead to treat COVID-19.

But the economy is not quite dead enough. They need a little more time.
Has anyone asked themself why Trump is incredibly eager to reopen the economy. Only one reason, reelection.
They are desperate to keep us on lockdown as long as they can drag it out to further destroy Trump's economy, push mail in voting, and to try and avoid the Presidential debates. I can't wait to see how they try to slither out of Dementia Joe debating Trump live on stage.

I can acknowledge the severity of COVID-19 and still be skeptical of the government. I can acknowledge the severity of COVID-19 and still believe that we need to start rebuilding the economy soon. All of this can be true at the same time.
We’re in great shape with the economy, we’re in great shape with jobs, we’re in great shape with the approval ratings, the polls, Florida’s beaches, good people on both sides, press conferences....like @ TheRickWilson says, everything that Trump touches, DIES....
Idk I've heard some close people complaining about "People are dying but what about the economy? We can't stay closed forever. We've earned a break I think."
If were in charge I would simply flip the switch from ‘unemployment’ to ‘employment’
Why would self employer need this when they not qualify for unemployment which in now $600 more per week than ever before and guaranteed for a longer time frame? Why isn’t is for small business? They are going bankrupt
VERY disappointing, Anita. Solo-preneurs have been totally left out as banks lend to those closer to 500 employees. As 'owners' don't even qualify for unemployment compensation.
Well here in Maine most of us are still waiting for our stimulas ,I literally have a time bomb in my right lung and can't work if I were to be infected it's all over,I've been working since the age of 13 and I'll be 55 in 2 days and still fighting to get unemployment
Please look into the unemployment problem in Florida. Only 4 percent claims processed
Isnt the logical response to a jobs guarantee the absolutely smashing/total removal of unemployment benefits? It is hard to sustain an argument that we should have a strong safety net if there is an option for everyone to have a job.

I’m not trying to sound callus, but the death rate is not any worse than anything else. It will only go down more once antibody testing gets going. 22 million people are new to unemployment in a matter with weeks. Add another 5-10 million to those who can’t get it.
I think they are counting on everyone being unemployed getting the extra $600 per week in addition to their states unemployment.....
It’s not your job to control our health, it’s ours! It’s our job to decide. We don’t want government control, we want a paycheck! Your bankrupting this state with more than half the state on unemployment!
You finally make a point that makes some sense. My brother is on unemployment and just got his first payment of 2 weeks. In 2 weeks he made $500 more than I do at $20 an hour 40 hours a week. ALL businesses open should pay an automatic 10 hours overtime w/backpay until reopening.
Throw in record unemployment - >22M unemployed

You should have mailed the masks with the unemployment pins that we’re still waiting for because we don’t have $ to but any or supplies to make them. You didn’t think about that now did you?
I really really REALLY REALLY hope I qualify for unemployment
Unemployment was 9.8% when he said this. And he didn't say it was a new normal. He said he was worried it could become one. Thankfully it didn't.
What?!?! Way worse! Unemployment is way less than their actual pay and no benefits! Those employees would definitely rather be on payroll. Get some common sense!

The unemployment system in your state is probably overwhelmed, hang in there, you should be getting your claim backdated to when you filed and getting a lump sum payment
I just personally know ppl having to go to food banks right now, & mired in the red tape of unemployment. They want to work and not to rely on “handouts” - their words, not mine. Imo you are correct about widespread antibody testing. And if it corroborates - open things up some
Better to send them to an unemployment line than an early grave.
And these numbers are just considering the direct impact of the social distancing measures and shutdown. The flow-on effects of that initial unemployment and other unexpected economic impacts will eventually hit other parts of the economy and job market.

We need to reclaim the narrative of progress. There is more to the future than global warming, hackers, unemployment due to automation, and Black Mirror. Read a book about life in 1920. Imagine what life in 2120 could be. If the world believes in progress again, we can have it.

because the state does not have any more money to give out and there is close to 1 million unemployed. many for 3-4 weeks without any unemployment money from the state you can stay home if you want but business needs to open

But by making those that ARE willing to accept those risks and go fund those systems (especially in WA state where unemployment is almost completely funded by payroll taxes) bleed the same funding systems dry there is much MUCH less money to help those that need it. (6)

Any full UBI isn’t happening, but multiple months of stimulus checks should be part of the debate. Extending the number of weeka of unemployment & of the $600/week federal unemployment money will also need an extension. And we need better oversight of the Phase 3 funds.

Carwashes, retailers, golf courses—these are just a few businesses my friends have worked very hard on over the years. Owners willing to take precautions, just want a chance to survive. Unemployment is skyrocketing. They want the governor to listen to their needs, not scoff.

If people are unemployed and they can’t get through to unemployment their company should be forced to pay the wages until something is done
I think the amount of people that are out of work that don’t qualify for unemployment benefits or the stimulus check because they work for cash and don’t file is being overlooked. A large amount of people are broken. I do hope you’re right though.

As unemployment approaches 20%, each 1% rise can result in 3.3% spike in drug OD/ 1% increase in suicides (National Bureau of Economic Research.) If unemployment hits 32%, ~77,000 Americans may die as a result. Will economic fallout mortality be greater than the virus itself?
Does not sound you qualified for state unemployment if you are only getting the Federal coverage for COVID-19, which is $600. If you did, you would get $350 on top of that each week.
Let's face it. I'm not getting my stimulus check or my unemployment benefits
It has to do with everything. Landlord's have access to PPP and bank funds more easily than others are getting unemployment--and for most the folks I know, even with the $600 that has yet to show up-it doesn't come close to their income. Landlord's could show some grave here.
A case can be made for recent graduates too though this is peak unemployment smh

Any business that received money through the PPP, I believe it has to be used to keep employees on staff. I’m all for any biz, large or small, keeping their staff employed with gov’t money. It lessens the burden on local unemployment offices. And I agree, St. Elmo is a local gem.

I’m not at all concerned about the economy as a whole, I’m very concerned by the unemployment among the working class. The wealthy can wait out the virus, the poor cannot. The social determinants research literature says poverty = death for poor. No good answers I think?
Like the person above beautifully states, none of us are risk-free, but it's selfish of us to support the forced unemployment and poverty of hundreds of thousands or millions in order to selfishly reduce that risk in the most minimal percentage imaginable
I fucked my unemployment up. I’m so over it I don’t even care no more. Lol
Another thing you feel down on. Why didn’t you think about food shortage before you closed Nevada. A long with unemployment, suicide, child abuse And Domestic violence

It is hoped that texas unemployment will be able to meet all its obligations. It does not appear that texas will re-open fast enough. And for many decisions have to be made on health insurance coverage.
Unfortunately I need money in order to pay my bills. I work for a company that is considered essential but I can work from home. If my employer calls me back into the office I have to go. If I refuse and they fire me I won't get unemployment. It's not a simple answer
Waiting to be picked by bill is the biggest let down ever. Congrats to the winners though I’m happy for you all. Just wish I had some kind a financial security since I got laid off, haven’t gotten my stimulus check & unemployment still hasn’t sent gotten in touch. $barbieslutzz
Reason why VA only has a 3.5, % unemployment. Lots of government workers. They keep getting paid. Some are home relaxing. Small businesses are closing. More and more rights being taken away, bc they put fear in our heads. Communism
The economy was on life support before this virus. The virus is a convenient scapegoat for the increase in unemployment & business closures. The inflated price to earnings ratio in the stock market doesn't equate to it's level. Feds propping up economy is Socialism.
Wow indeed. Ed "thought" Trump was worth taking a risk on. Then he spent 3 years not noticing trade deals, tax cuts, deregulation, energy independence, record low unemployment. Now his thought is we need someone younger. Perhaps we could get him to have a thought about China.

Of course layoffs are coming. No one disputing that. Question is what is actual unemployment rate when everyone knows a vaccine coming early 2021. 9%? 10%? Is the rate of change in economic data getting worse or better? That’s what the market cares about.
Crazy how you can really be running up a check through unemployment

They just care about driving up the unemployment numbers so they can blame it on Pres. Trump. They do can care about the people or their loss of jobs. History as proven this. Simple as That.
No they aren't unemployment has a maximum amount depending on how much you would normally make I'm not sure what the percentage is at this time but it used to be $500 maximum and now they get $600 more so if you get $200 it's that plus $600 =$800
Washington state website crashes after seeing ‘a tsunami of claims’ for new coronavirus unemployment benefits https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/state-website-crashes-after-seeing-a-tsunami-of-claims-for-new-coronavirus-unemployment-benefits/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=article_inset_1.1 … via @ seattletimes
What I think is coming: Unemployment is exploding. The programs adopted so far covered too few for too short a period. So, there are 3 options. 1. Massive direct wage support as in Europe; 2. Back to work, risk the spread; 3. Widespread desperation. GOP prefers 2, would accept 3.

OTOH - the ECB could literally create a trillion euros out of thin air, deposit it into every EU bank account - call it a 100 year loan, whatever. UK only recently paid the last WW1 bonds aka printed money. With EU nations rocking up unemployment @30% from 5% inside of weeks...
Unemployment needs to hurry tf up.
For those on SSI/Disability your financial situations have not changed opposed to those who have lost jobs and are waiting for unemployment so hold your horses!

Yeah, the whole thing was to "not overwhelm hospitals." There's no way to *eradicate* this virus anytime soon. So it was about flattening the curve. @ GovInslee changed it up on us. Now 15% unemployment rate. Food bank lines in every city. https://twitter.com/EvanAult/status/1251984342500274176 …
The $600 per week is automatically added to your weekly unemployment. In Nevada it’s a separate check but you do not apply for it separately, as long as you’re eligible for unemployment the $600 is added automatically
@ GovMurphy HELP needed with unemployment. Filed a month ago, all of my colleagues received their $ and I did not! I can’t get anyone on the phone or any email reply from DOL. Help! I have bills to pay. Please.
The # Nevada # unemployment system is still not allowing # SelfEmployedMatterToo to file! We’ll be back to work before we get a dime because of the incompetent @ GovSisolak and # NV03 @ RepSusieLee # Oneanddone # OpenAmerica @ POTUS
The unemployment has nothing to do with Trump. Also when we see the rebound will see exactly how good the economy is doing!

Just filled my unemployment benefits forms for the week. On state website. I sit back and wait until funds hit my account on Monday $3G

Well there would have been less unemployment if you asshats would have passed a one page paycheck protection plan bill.

MN and Sweden have similar unemployment now, in 10-12% range. A 90% taxation on uber wealth in Minnesota (as during WW2) could easily raise $ to send nice checks each month to work from home/volunteer, keep only essential businesses open with extreme safety measures in place.
They are the ones crying for unemployment
No...they don’t deserve a dime of unemployment benefits. They need to get their asses back to work, help the President get things done, quit complaining and start earning their tax payer salaries!
I our unemployment system which was ruined by rick scott and continued by desantis both Republicans, both are going to cause your hero to lose florida ... and which will also cause him to lose the election... but hey congrats on your new president biden
Joe Biden hosting a town hall on unemployment is like Nancy Pelosi hosting a town hall on how to use supermarket coupons.
This, the unemployment compensation scam, long food lines, NO testing, GOP trying to kill the USPS, *these* are news stories ! Yet you spend 2-3 hrs/day airing Trump rallies and talking all day about them. We're not getting any real news from # MSNBC, anymore. # amjoy @ Morning_Joe
4/ In response to the COVID pandemic, state and national economies have been "deliberately crashed" (Deaton). Social distancing mandates and related measures are resulting in massive unemployment. This COVID response induced recession is designed to save lives.

Not only has Pelosi’s put Millions in unemployment lines and with there nonexistent action to fund the next phase for Small Business and citizens. They will be in bankruptcy lines next if the Democrats don’t act with out all the Bull crap included.

Just got denied 4/20 off. Lmao guess who already got approved for unemployment and isn’t showing up to work tomorrow
They’re lying to you. Under @ BarackObama and @ JoeBiden, unemployment was cut in half and wages rose in all sectors. Fact: The U.S. economy, in shambles now w/o a plan to repair it, had slowed even before COVID-19. Joe Biden has experience in economic recoveries. Trump doesn’t.
Most people aren't going to blame Trump for unemployment caused by responses to a pandemic.
Most states have expanded unemployment for people who can't work due to the virus.
How many of those deaths occurred due to lack of treatment during hydroxychloroquin ban? Additionally, how do we compare nationwide when it comes to unemployment? Lastly, of those unemployed, the percent that has received their unemployment benefits?

When speaking in the Rose Garden, George Bush (the son) said, "...and even with the stock market crash...". There was no stock market crash, he must have gotten truth and lies mixed up. The TV broadcast immediately stopped showing the speech.

If people stop thinking stock market as economy, it will.
Many mistakenly believe the stock market is an indicator of a good economy. It’s actually an indicator of how effectively working people are being taken advantage of. There are other far more accurate indicators. Home ownership, land ownership for instance. Spending power, too.

under Obama the economy was very strong, low unemployment, booming stock market. I only took Trump 3.5 years to crash the stock market, destroy the economy and cause record unemployment. Trump was warned of covid19 in January. He ignored it, called it a hoax. The result is this.
My belief is this was all an attack on trump and the economy. Now alot of truth is comin out about this whole shit and the stock market is rising again. The Dems are pissed and thats why theyre still fearmongerin and keepin us inside but theyre gonna have to deal with Trump again
I think trump should stay in office until 2024. I want to see how fucked up this country can get and still have a good stock market. That way it’s proven it’s a manipulated scam.

The DJIA just posted its best 2-week run in 82 years… All while the United States recorded 22 million job losses. This should destroy any notion of the stock market being tied to how good the economy is. Next time Trump tries to tell you that he’s good for the economy? Nope.

Why are you using pics from this school to talk abt universities shutting down for good from the virus? We all know this would be the last school to go. I used to work for the business school & the amount of $ they throw in every direction is absurd. They’re going to be fine.
# PelosiMustGo. So it's "model behavior" to be open for business to crowds of ppl invited by Pelosi herself. But Pres Trump is evil for not shutting other businesses down before there was a problem. # ThesePeopleAreStupid
Independent owner operators make up about 80 to 90% of all freight moved across the U.S . Most owner operators in trucking are smart to shut down when the cost is more than the profit. It is just common business sense! And most are shutting down! We demand profits not loss!
No one is proposing "shutting down NE business forever". The current plans all involve waiting until the outbreak is declining an area, and then widely testing and isolating the vulnerable.
Shutting the fuck up and minding your own business. Quit worrying about the next bitch or what she’s doing. Weirdo https://twitter.com/DegreatMurster/status/1246125868105314304 …
You haven't substantiated this idea that we cannot test and isolate the most vulnerable. We are testing 1.2 million per week currently, and our capacity is increasing by the day. And since shutting down NE business forever is impossible, it is again our least bad option.
Prude- embroiled in the Aspen Skiing Outbreak- her n her husband have it and don’t iso upon returning Trude- VERY anti shutting businesses (bcos of their fountain gate business), thinks we should pursue herd immunity route
IMO we can’t do what we are doing right now (shutting schools, non-essential business, etc) ‘again.’ If we start opening things this summer and kids go back to school this fall, we cannot go back, we HAVE to go forward.
Dear senator Cruz, you need to introduce legislation that no foreigners should ever own the majority in any business in the United States. Chinese billionaire shutting down pork processing plants? Why?

Yes, two positive cases, but I thought that the NBA was very progressive in shutting down a multi-billion dollar business almost immediately after that. They were the sports business and culture leaders.
Eh, we took very strict quarantine measures during the Spanish flu pandemic. Business owners were thrown in jail for not shutting down and people were fined for not wearing masks. And fear has nothing to do with it... 1/
There's still no lockdown in Japan, but stores and restaurants are voluntarily shutting down to curb the spread of coronavirus When a country trusts its government is understands and cooperates.

And lastly it’s easy to say that wind will generate more business when you’re not the person whose job would be taken away by doing that. Is a very lucky position to be able to create a solution for climate change and have the shutting down of businesses not affect you personally
“The question was asked are you shutting down the other similar business.....answer no because no one has turned them in yet.”
Re-open markets now! We are not children. If you or Governers give an order that all business's require facemasks &/or gloves the people will follow. This is no different then what hospitals require, so whats the problem? Shutting down the economy was a mistake (other then China)
A 30 day quarantine is reasonable & 60 days is asking a lot. After that, reopening business w/ masks & social distancing for another 30-60 days is reasonable. But shutting down businesses calling them non-essential indefinitely based on a perceived risk is stealing liberty.
What about the Chinese billionaire that owns Smithfield shutting some plants down trying to hurt the economy even more. How is he allowed to own an American business. I’m losing mine, trucking , thanks to my bank not turning in my application for PPP

Look at all the business owners who got millions and billions in bailouts call for workers to return early after only shutting down 4 to 6 weeks. Workers who are scheduled to receive an extra $600 a week in unemployment over a period of 16 weeks, may only see 25% of it.

I’m going around shutting down all these business but people need money and it doesn’t feel right. And the only reason why I’m shutting them down is because people who aren’t working are calling on them so he has to go shut them down.
This business of shutting of socializing is BS! I hear ya! We are social creatures
State governors are ordering business shut downs, not the President. And there’s plenty of video out there w high profile Democrats mocking DT for shutting down travel from China when he did.
My favorite part of type 1 diabetes is when I'm just minding my own business and suddenly feel every cell in my body shutting down and then I'm on the floor weakly yelling for someone to bring me some juice.
Yes just saw a story about how small business money was going to not so small businesses , basically shutting out actual small businesses. Does anybody consuls chain that is across America a small busy, evidently Shake Shack,Ruth Chris Steak House are considered small businesses
Would you expect every MD to use their personal wealth to support the business they are shutting down for an unknown length of time or just her? I’d imagine like many, her business is separate from her personal life. Does the retention scheme prohibit her applying? Thought not.
I hope he does reopen the aconony- that would be the smart thing to do. There are so many SIRBORN diseases out there; and we haven't had to stay home for those; why covid? It's a contact disease is it not? What's the real reason behind shutting everything down?
Smithfield which is run by the Chinese are shutting down pork processing plants in the United States which they say are due to Wuhan Fever. Why do we allow a communist regime to own an American company. Of course they will say a billionaire Chinese business man owns it. Wink Wink
Combined with the fact that over 90% of small businesses did not get PPP loan, many of these businesses won’t make it to the other side. And the argument that the 2nd round of PPP is coming won’t matter. I know of 3 small business owners that didn’t get loan - shutting down
I think the thinking plays into the narrative that business owners just have money but it ignores that a lot of the money businesses make are tied up alongside debt and have very shaky cash flow cycles. If one mistake is made a lot of these businesses end up shutting down.
We are on a road to economic destruction. And I think we are going to find out NYC and a couple other locations needed the severe lockdowns. Moderate precautions would have worked elsewhere including shutting down sports everywhere. But the business shutdowns need to end. Soon.
They are probably going to find that 1% of the country has it but most are asymptomatic. The overall mortality rate is going to plummet and people will start to ask if shutting down the global economy was the correct response.
So shutting down a hospital in an area where we have zero cases and holding up surgeries for people who need them all because of fear mongering makes sense to you? I will not be bankrupting my family or business because you’re a sheep.

I never said anything about unlimited rights. Rights are defined. Anything prohibitive to those are an abuse of power. Gov has limited authority. Shuttering schools, suspending concerts/fairs etc/ ok. Shutting down private business, limiting ppl's movements, abuse of power.

Thatcher should have pushed employee ownership instead of shutting business down and forcing hard working Brits onto welfare. But like Reagan, none too smart.
With this pandemic shutting down everything. If you find that your government bailout cheque is not enough. The ag business can sure use your help.
Whether they're sincere or not is none of your business. If someone is asshole enough to fake compliment you, that's on them. Beyond that, start with just saying "thank you" and then shutting up. It's super hard, but it just takes practice.
I don’t go to work, I work from home, I do my one piece of outdoor exercise a day and only go the the shop when i really need to. I’m just saying we can’t stop every business from shutting, how would the economy survive.We’d be in deep trouble!!That’s not a belief that’s a fact
It bothers me that Health professionals are shutting down the economic sector instead of following guidelines. I can’t wait to operate on my first patient! I have as much training at that as they do as an economist or small business owner.
That would be the largest fleecing of American business in the history of the country. Government shuts down business, government refuses to pay business for shutting it down, government claims business because it can't pay debt. What you're talking about is criminal theft

This COVID thing is not about vaccines! It is about shutting our economy down and blaming Trump. Millions of people do what ever their doctor tells them to do. The fastest way to chip people is to open the country and get back to business as usual.
I think you’re missing the point. Family business’ are going bankrupt and shutting down because people can’t “dine-in” or go shop there. Open your mind and see what’s happening around you.
How is South Carolina ready when we were one of the last states to start shutting down everything because none of you believe in science? We all know you worship @ realDonaldTrump but listen to doctors and scientists...not business owners who are ready to exploit their workers.

GOP Senate blocked providing sufficient funds for unemployed families while giving billions to corporate business. Then they blame democrats for shutting down nonessential businesses.
While the rest of the world has been shutting down schools, shops and restaurants, banning non-essential travel, and sending the police to shout at those who dare to dawdle in their local park, Sweden remains largely open for business.
Protesting the disease is a mischaracterization. Liberal democracies have no business in forcing people into hiding and shutting it all down. Governments should be focused on presenting data, testing and tracing. People need to think for themselves and behave responsibly.
Very inept use of the “tools” then. Shutting down business with no unemployment system capability. Exec orders with arbitrary restrictions. References to “data” and “science” but show crude charts that are nowhere near data or science-based. What state are you living in, denial?
Yes, give WHO taxpayer funds while shutting out small business. She doesn't care a bit about the backbone of America!
Explain Czech Republic, they managed to slow the spread without fooling its people, without shutting down business and not jail everyone at home. Why we have to learn the hard way?
We the people need to file class action lawsuits against DemoFascist Governors for violating our 1st amendment rights of free assembly. They are also in violation of Commerce Clause for shutting down business.
So you seriously think denying entry to a few hundred businesspeople over a period of weeks equates to "effectively shutting down parts of the economy"? Where did you get your masters in business, Trump University? Unless you recognise those "parts" = ~0.0000005% of the economy!
That mat we’ll be, but making a decision about one business versus shutting down an entire economy is an entirely different decision.
Sure, while we're all sitting at home thinking 'woulda, shoulda, coulda', it's easy to look to blame people in positions of responsibility, and to forget they are flawed humans who were attempting to keep things 'business as usual'. Nobody had any inkling we'd be shutting down...
Has nothing to do with shutting down the business. And if such a business was cited for violating such laws, they would have due process to contest the charges in court. No due process under Hugo Chavez Evers' edicts from on high. Due process is verboten in WI, it seems.
Personally I think shutting the schools was the first stage of business lockdown. You think how many people converge on the schools each day and then how many people can't work without childcare.

Federal courts are in session. It took a federal judge about 15 minutes to rebuke the Louisville mayor's attack on ppl practicing their religion in the cars. Shutting down a business w/o due process is a clear violation of the Fifth Amendment.

It seems to me this has been key. The testing, tracing and subsequent mandatory isolation. At the beginning of this I was so worried for my family in Oz, because while we were shutting down, they were business as usual. Now I too am surprised (and envious).

I read about how The UK dealt with the great plague. Very similar responses to today. Shutting ports, shutting non essential business, banning social gatherings, cancelling any event with a crowd, and ordering people to stay indoors. Even then they were up against it.
That’s bullshit. Trump was telling us he had it under control. That it was isolated. That it would be gone soon. You conveniently forget that. He also hasn’t endorsed shutting NY down. Shit, if he had his way NYC would still be open for business.
Democrats blocked aid for small business owners again. Dems are really Socialist Communists who are shutting down businesses to get us all dependent on Big Government crumbs. All property & businesses would be transferred to their control under their regime. Freedom # Trump2020

Australia is doing just as well without shutting down the entire economy. But there’s no Bloomberg article about that because the Australian Prime Minister is a white male conservative.

Baby. Every essential business shutting down the same way. How the workers supposed to get to work, please? pic.twitter.com/SLhUytXv4u
I’m confused with this but ok! I’m an “essential” worker and work in the field. It’s only shutting down small businesses and not allowing us to go inside to eat or use facilities . Since this has started traffic has been worse. We are open just small business is not.
You do that by shutting down large gatherings of any kind, Non essential businesses or limit the way business can operate, etc. You complain they've taken your rights. Which rights have they taken? They've restricted the right to assemble. That's it.
Since you feel the need to poke your nose in our business, he's standing up for Americans who's rights are being trampled by over reaching Governors. Shutting down Church by car, but not drive through? 2nd Amendment? Fishing? Planting gardens, you have plenty to worry about in UK
We can all take preventative measures without the government shutting down selective industries. Everywhere I go, people are social distancing appropriately and every open business is taking special precautions. I'm not saying we shouldn't have done anything, just not this.
Of course Anne Frank wasn’t hiding due to her local governor/mayor shutting down the family business based on models that have repeatedly been inaccurate. You think every person stuck at home can afford those luxuries? So out of touch with real society.
I see Oprah is coping well. She isn’t missing a meal or shutting a business down.
I’d like to see a particular virus written into the plot of Ozark season 4, exploring the chaotic politics of shutting down (and potentially reopening) a small town and how a nationwide pandemic’s affect on “business” could prove dangerous in more ways than one.

Cigarette smokers don't die easily either with COPD. I suspect the path taken was probably best for overall well being. Without shutting down business the way we did, maybe infections and bedlam in the hospitals would have been a much worse trajectory.
It's not the isolation it's the loosing you home or business. It's not a staycation it's shutting down the country and people's livelihood.
You're really not wrong here, unfortunately shutting down non essential business was a precaution needed to prevent the spread of the virus... but it did cause a crash in the economy, of course it wouldn't matter who was president this would have happened anyway.
But that's not capitalism. This is gov't stepping in and shutting down businesses that are causing the layoffs. If business could continue as usual, her parents would likely not have been laid off and she would be fine. Instead ppl scared of covid forced her in this position.

Canada was a bit different than the US. US per capita debt to GDP growth was negative throughout the recovery. The popular attitude on debt following the GFC changed a bit. The current event may affect not only consumers but corporations as well.
Under certain conditions and contexts there are of course boundaries. But those popularly perceived under many circumstances are merely self-limiting beliefs that unnecessarily impoverish The People. Remember that next time one shows you a chart of govt debt as %gdp...

Yes, let's put equity and debt on the same footing, but the right way to do this is with the FairTax, which does not tax saving and investment at all. The USA gets a reliable 44% GDP return on nonresidential assets, so the way to maximize prosperity is to maximize investment.

Well that is just the nicest thing you could hear! Our babies are at school most of their lives. For us to get more time with then is such a great thing. I’d take a halving of GDP if it meant a more simple life for everyone. More parent at home with kids for example.
That GDP/national comparison stuff is finished.
No one is really bothered about Brexit Mark. The few points in GDP that may have been temporarily lost are irrelevant when the pandemic will cause a massive economic jolt across the world. Brexit is a rounding off figure in comparison.
Depends on the situation. Imagine a country with high debt & no ability to borrow further, that didn’t intend to default. All debt servicing would occur through tax dollars. Combined public+private debt relative to GDP would show proportion of output committed to lenders
These figures (https://www.facebook.com/john.hassler.96/posts/10158392636579885 …) suggest Sweden's economy has saved 1.3% of GDP compared to the Nordics this far (see link). So I think CBA cannot justify not copying some low-cost Norwegian measures, but CBA can justify not shutting down.
# COVID19Alert Concepcion: 83 percent of our cases come from NCR and CALABARZON. 50 percent of our GDP comes from NCR and CALABARZON. That's big.
I also played around with whether the Swedish stance is crazy according to standard CBA. If people lose 5 years on average, we risk 100,000 life years. That is roughly 100 bn SEK = 2% of GDP.

Revenue and GDP are known (Public sources), and we spent 2.2 trn naira on debt servicing in 2018(about 45% of revenue) and still got loans to refinance debts in subsequent years, if this % keeps increasing and we still keep getting loans then I don’t think it’s the basis.

The problem is that the 'greatest economy' that is the US is not so great at all. Excessive debt has made this economy fragile when so much of GDP is dependent on the consumer who simply cannot be enticed to continue borrowing due to low rates any more. They are tapped out.

Real GDP is expected to contract by 8.5 % in 2020, 13.9 pp lower than the baseline (pre-COVID-19). This is mostly due to the slump in tourism, which directly and indirectly accounts for two-thirds of GDP, but also due to suppressed construction activity. # Maldives @ WorldBank
If india have learned anything then atleast india will use atleast 10% of gdp on health sector..as we can see what is the situation of health department..
Really? What's the gdp of all Arab nations compared to Bharat? Statistics show China is treating Uighurs very dwell, but people know well don't they , Mr. pakistan, you would be naive to think world will revert to fossil fuel after this hiccup of worldwide pandemic.

The point is.....Debt to GDP is meaningless....
Keir Starmer should be in the 'honeymoon period' Boris Johnson - has delivered disastrous Brexit [sic] - is exposed as a lazy incompetent clown - is being slated by the Right Wing press ! Thousands of Brits dying, losing their livelihoods, GDP crashing If not now, when ?
look at external debt to exports -- and how it evolved under macri. need a sensible ratio of external debt service to exports. implies significant relief imo (+ need to adjust the GDP number down -- and look at all debt held by non-residents, not just foreign law bonds)
However, there is one thing that I haven't been looking at: the UK's debt. The most recent figures I can find for UK debt put it at about 90% of GDP, and one of the ways that this is often tackled (sometines accidentally) is through inflation - literally inflate away the debt

So in one breath he brags about the country being so rich then in the next he whines about how much it gives away. Hey, you pretend to be "news" why don't you show us all how the U.S. ranks for contributions to other countries (per capita by gdp)

And what is a "sustainable" profile? According to the IMF a few months ago, the stock of international law bonds was just 10% of Argentine GDP. The nominal size of Argentina debt stock is not the problem, it's the maturity profile created by stupid local law bills & the IMF.
We may emerge with a more productive workforce and depending on the decisions that are made that workforce could build a stronger economy which could become better in measures other than annual GDP.
the net effect is interest rates go down and we are left with more disposable income. More money more production, more production more GDP like you production which we don't have unfortunately

So back to your point.....GDP to Debt matters NONE... what matters are 1. Gold Reserves (cash) 2. Largest exchange (access to cash) its revenues i.e. Cash....not size of economy
The answers to these questions, more than the scale of any short-term plunge in gdp, will be the true measures of the effectiveness of the responses of governments, companies and banks.
Ever think that Germany and the Europeans etc who have health care for all, can have that because we are paying for their defense? If we cut our defense bill in half, we would have $500 billion for the welfare of our citizens and still be spending more than any of them GDP wise

And Denmark ofc with its CA surplus of 8% of GDP, a lot of it with US...
Hence, US is not the best example to analyse Debt to GDP ratio. Context for each country differs. You are right. Lenders will keep lending to US. However,to sustain their position they will do anything. Wars, stimulus packages etc.
Businesses used to reserve for things that now they simply wait on the govt for help. Businesses have paid lower than inflation-adj wages for almost 40 yrs now. There’s also no relationship between GDP growth & worker wages. Any growth is all at the top. /2

disagree with you on this -- need a sustainable debt profile, and then need to deliver on their payment commitments while debt to GDP falls. Haircuts to clear away the overhang created by big borrowing with no export growth inevitable
That is not clearly true . The demand for oil has fallen and risen before but there will always be a demand for oil once everything returns to normal . To say JA is I’m a great position compare to other Caribbean islands you are misinformed . JA GDP is only above Haiti .

In addition, can you imagine the impact on the value of the US dollar. It would become worthless. At least right now, though it is not backed by gold or silver, it is backed by a massive GDP. Take away the GDP and there will be no way to prop up the dollar. Hmmm

Right wing economic commentators don't get that demand reductions were inevitable and that structured social institutions shutting down dramatically impacts the economy (schools/medial). Heck, almost 18% of your GDP is in medical, but people want to ignore that.

I heavily disagree. The economic rise of the industrial world brought poverty to the farmlands of the 19th century, hence making them uninhabitable and raising the global GDP by 16.37%.
