A UBI as suggested I would agree. But I would see it as a stepping stone towards Yangs version of a UBI which utilizes a VAT, and NOT government handouts. The VAT just keeps the economy flowing and people capable of living. https://youtu.be/vhgaPVO8aw8

medical system is overwhelmed. The elderly citizens do not contribute to the overall well-being of the economy. So maybe you create a virus that specifically targets the elderly and infirm and release it upon a highly populated city. If the virus spreads and damages your 2/?

The economy is going to tank and collapse. The Govt. is proposing the Army needs to be on the streets (to protect Supermarkets, NHS) and people will be forced to stay at home to “self isolate” Curfews. Rationing coming. This all caused by a flu virus. Create the problem...

I believe it's the Dems just trying to ruin a great economy Trump has been helping build. They know they can't beat him so they'll do anything to make him look bad.
What’s really very disappointing is the government’s re-election patter was all “you can’t trust them, you can trust us” which isn’t that unusual, but they also added the “only we can manage the economy etc” and they have demonstrated that when it really matters, they can’t.

People are dying and the economy is cratering. But, do take some time off and drink some beer.
The threat of the virus is directly proportional to quantity of people coming in close contact with the virus. Draper is encouraging that contact. Economics will rebound the sooner the virus passes. The comment that the bad economy will kill more people is idiotic on its face.
Because the stock market bounce you expect trump to get will make him think he's got leverage over us. He'll say nothing is more important than to stabilize the economy. Cue --- the tax cuts.

Do you seriously think comparing the nrl to the nba/epl is sensible? Would we compare the aus economy to the USA? NRL said if they are advised to shut down they will. They were pretty upfront and said what is pretty obvious to everyone - they will lose significant $ if they shut
Honest question: is that type of life style reasonable for 12-18 months? Fully understand slowing the curve, but I’m curious how long the economy can handle these sort of measures
If we carry on the mass irrational panic, and totally crash the economy, how many will be able to afford to visit grandparents, or help feed and look after them , it's a double edged sword

Well if 70% of the economy gets infected, 65% of them won’t be able to get the medical care they need because the country’s medical care system isn’t ready for that. So i’d rather have everyone sit at home for 3 weeks & minimize infections, than see people die on hospital doors.
It’s about flattening the curve - spreading out the incidence of occurrence & thereby giving the health service a better chance of coping. Take no measures &, believe me, the economy will be the last thing anyone will have to worry about.

Actually, this is what happens when prices don't reflect new conditions. In a socialist economy, the government thinks it knows better and freezes prices. Prices should go up now, to make people think twice before hoarding. Otherwise, shortages will ensue.

The difference is in a socialist economy the houses are just as empty as the shelves, In this one all these empty shelves means peoples garage and basements are full... also the shelves don't get restocked.

Wilbur Ross said # COVIDー19 would help our economy. Why isn’t it? Trump said it was a hoax. Why isn’t it? Trump fired the pandemic team who could have prepared us and lessened the severity. Why are Republicans so dumb?
We work in the Food Industry. We've been called immortals. We can't complain even if we are in a life-threatening situation when going to work. Schools are closed. Offices are closed. Malls are empty. Events were called off. Flights are grounded. Economy is down.
Maybe because they're tryna fight it genius? And exactly what government is doing this because literally the whole world has stopped, possibly almost every country's economy is gonna suffer and many people working for the government have the virus as well..
Just to confirm, I understand Dr. Hinshaw is a public health expert and trust her expertise. However, I do not trust the UCP government to put the health of children before the health of the oil and gas economy.
Dont understand the delay , just close the pubs and restaurants. The quicker we take action. The quicker we will be back to normal. Yes jobs will suffer. But people will live. They economy will recover quickly and jobs will return. Why only do half the job.
Maybe, I think that's a separate discussion. This is more a temporary mini-Marshal plan for US citizens to avoid what I think could be very damaging 2nd and 3rd order effects stemming from the shut down of the world's largest economy.

If I have a test, I'd at least know if I have to worry or not. Is it just a cold or the flu or is it that unknown, potentially far more lethal virus than falsely claimed in the past? Why not test? I tell you why: The want to prevent a lockdown in order to protect the economy.
Stop making everyone panic! You are causing people to lose their jobs and are having dramatic affects on the economy. Stop selling fear!! Start telling people this is nothing compared to the flu!!
Yo. If your friends/partners/family etc come in from a highly contagious area to see you. You. Have. To. Wait. This is life or death for the elderly, the immuno compromised, the economy. Stop being so fucking selfish.
The covid19 impact on the Canadian economy is yet to be fully understood but it is a reminder that exogenous threats and danger exists that can only be addressed and overcome by economic strength. Self mutilation of Canada’s economy is treasonous (and stupid)
I think this last point is incredibly important and often missed in the more febrile reports and scare stories. The strategy needs to protect the susceptible, manage the NHS resource and not crash the economy - a big ask!

I have no idea what my future holds right now. My job already told me that unless me filing for unemployment takes affect, I’m shit out of luck and not getting paid. If you even just RT this it would help me immensely, and I hate to ask, but I could really use help financially.+
Understand the difficulties @ mike_yeah, but employers are also not getting paid for the events you can't work at, plus losses eg whatever else was purchased for the events. Where does the money come from? Don't say it's their problem because that attitude increases unemployment

Capitalists keep unemployment around even when it's entirely unnecessary because workers' basic survival is tied to employment, so they can use unemployment as a threat against the working class in order to coerce them into more exploitable (and thus, more profitable) conditions.

Check your local Labor Board. You may be eligible for temporary unemployment if mandated to quarantine or work stoppage due to closure.
Sales taxes are just one part of the situation! Federal & state govs will get hit hard, e.g., if unemployment rises & income tax revenues decline. But our local governments are quite reliant on sales. A national pseudo-quarantine will eviscerate them. They will need help. /end

Have you considered the impact of people staying home? Businesses will fail, unemployment will skyrocket, poor people will suffer most. The PM in the UK is doing what his scientific advisers recommend. Can you explain why we should listen to you and not them?
Idk either... I’m applying for unemployment on Monday but like no where is going to be hiring because all these companies are shutting down due to the virus
Thats why, if this does get like Italy, especially in specific regions of the country...they need to explore not only stopping evictions, but moratoriums on mortgages and rent. Also if you lose your job thru no fault of your own, unemployment is a remedy

The big picture is: France has one of the highest tax and redistribution rate and largely free healthcare, low utilities cost and high minimum wage (and high unemployment). Yes million French people protest just for the heck of it, this is how they are.
I am a sub teacher working long term in the wealthiest county in CA and teacher's unions made sure subs wouldn't get unemployment insurance when they shut down. Where's my sick leave if one of the snot nose brats gives me the flu? Where's my free stuff?http://www.billfoxsoapbox.com
You can still collect unemployment if you only work one day. They just make up the difference
What about small small businesses, who are losing revenue? And the bills still coming in? The underemployed, part-time workers who has to subsidize income from retirement of SSA? What about those whose unemployment benefits have stopped? How about the subcontractor?

Im not so sure Mickey Mouse will give you the economy Trump has given you, lowest unemployment in 70 yrs, lowest unemployment for women, African Americans, Asians, Latinos EVER. Ur hero was President for 8 yrs and did? NOTHING!! OH WAIT You can keep ur plan & u can keep ur Doctor
#45 has broken many records with stock market, unemployment, bringing jobs back to America etc. Unless your just to ignorant to acknowledge these facts. Hands down...best President in my 50 years!! And compared to deceitful, disrespectful, dishonest Democrats... Winning!!
that's what unemployment benefits are for
I'm all in for an unemployment type system for sick pay. But the logistics can't put a dime of burden on the business owner or else the shop will close and everybody's unemployed. These places do not have extra $$ laying around. Many survive week to week or month to month.
Since the Federal government is backstopping Paid sick leave and we are in a 3.5% unemployment environment, the amount of joblessness this will cause will be contained as companies try to retain skilled workers.
That’s still a LOT of money for a part time worker who just got laid off. And unfortunately since this program was only part time students won’t qualify for unemployment benefits.
Probably related to whether their employees can get unemployment benefits or not....
She is a moron, anyone unemployed by no fault of their own, ie a business shutting down for a month due to Coronavirus would be eligible for unemployment insurance. Universities are accommodating students who can not go home. She is an assclown, making this about her agenda!
I work retail here in NYC. Business has been bad eventually the store will have to close. Which means relying on NY State Unemployment Insurance forbwhi knows how long. Plus the possibility of catching this plague in this very crowded city
Ron, what is going to happen to really small business and people who would not qualify for unemployment due to hour restrictions? What about the part-time worker who has to work to make bills because SSA isn't enough? Please make this know too!
There are these things called statistics, NZ lower unemployment, lower child & pensioner poverty, economy growing, science based policy and give a shit about their citizens.

If we get an unemployment insurance package that extends to independent contractors, I'll be a big fan of his. If not, I'm gonna be very upset. Cuz this school closing business just put me out of a job for most of the month.

Not as bad as the soup lines and massive unemployment we would get with your proposals the problem we are having is the lack of response and leadership from the White House we can improve the existing system ,keep choice and add a public option which has a chance of becoming law

Not much analysis on why its shocking when B doesn’t acknowledge Tulsi, Yang, etc’s obstacles.reach out and policies haven’t been great. Calling for solidarity but 90% just M4A and vague unemployment is a perfect example of him not actually doing so when even AOC is adjusting
I feel like one specific group is being forgotten, but certainly suffering in these unprecedented times: the bookies. Can’t exactly stand in unemployment line.
Unemployment benefits are for ALL people who’ve worked & now are unemployed
Yes! Instead of telling your drivers to wash their hands & stay home if sick (with no pay), how about you drop your ballot measure, meaningfully help your drivers & start providing healthcare, unemployment insurance & paid sick days that every other employer is required to do! https://twitter.com/ssmith_calabor/status/1238960151773581312 …

@ USTreasury & @ federalreserve needs to start modeling how the Federal government can encourage innovation in the next 20 years outside the corporate world as they’re forced to ease us into a Japan like zombie economy in order to avoid the death and pain of unemployment/recession.
It is carpet bombing. If I remember right, it has 7 divisions which can and should be considered separately. A quick scan of the bill makes me believe people can get payments from SSA and unemployment for the same time off work.
I have to accept that either my government A) does not realize the majority of people in the US are 2-3 weeks’ worth of unemployment away from homelessness or B) does not care
How much will I get per month from the government on an unemployment check? Trying to plan ahead and see if it’ll support my lifestyle
With so many deaths it would open up many jobs so 0% unemployment is now possible another win for @ realDonaldTrump
I lived in France for a few months. It is a beautiful shithole. What's the point in having paid sick leave when you can't get a job? People who aren't "made" spend their lives doing contract work where they work like slaves. Youth unemployment is practically everyone.
I understand unemployment I was laid off from my job of 20 years. Sucks but I know there are worse things in life
We could treat it like unemployment insurance; the gov. pays (with our without employer and employee copays). We don't need a billionaire class people. We need to create a system that works for us.
Yes expanded unemployment would be great unless you are working for cheapskates who call you self-employed therefore not having anyone paying into unemployment insurance, if EVERYONE who isn't working is eligible of course
But apply for unemployment!!! People displaced from their job bc of the corona virus qualify !!

Why are we still reporting on the unemployment rate? It’s becoming less valuable and less important. What we should be reporting on is the percentage of people earning less than the cost of living, I would argue that is far more relevant.
All of their hourly employees live paycheck to paycheck and getting them hours while they can is all they can try to do. Unemployment assistance in many cases isn’t enough to cover rent and basic living expenses.
How bout you pay them? You cant exoect employers to pay workers who dont work..there is unemployment insurance for those in need
Unemployment benefits or Foodstamps
Please make sure the Pullman School District bus drivers get paid. They are not allowed to collect Unemployment Insurance during breaks. And they are now forced into a 6 week break. Most of them are extremely concerned right now.
Govt keeps talking about ensuring people stay in jobs. At this point, they'd probably be better preparing for ~1M people enrolling for benefits to supplement lost income. Unemployment might just be the next 'pandemic' facing # Australia # insiders # COVIDー19 # coronavirus
Congress is trying to figure out how to handle all this unemployment, thankfully for them they haven’t worked in year! Does it read? how can I make it better?
Every employer pays into unemployment insurance. The same amount. Does not matter how many they have laid off or whatever. There is no benefit for an employer to pay or not pay unemployment. The state does that, using funds every employer pays into.
You close pubs and shops for 10-12 weeks and suddenly you've 15% unemployment again, massive welfare bills, and a country with 200bn in national debt. It took us a decade to recover last time. And it inflicted horrendous austerity.

Can small business owners get unemployment checks to help them from going out of business. They pay into taxes more than the workers do. It’s only fair.
And you can apply for Unemployment Benefits & if ya got kids you can apply for TANF
What do you write about? Not familiar with terms GPA, and CNA. I Live in UK... OK historian giving me a clue? Sorry to hear about the unemployment. You're in good company with the global panic... LOL
Or perhaps you should be getting some temporary unemployment benefits to cover your rent. While large corporate landlords may not miss a month or two, the Mom and Pop who are letting out their upstairs flat and using the proceeds to pay the mortgage are getting killed, too.

No, it really wouldn't. That's not what's needed now. That's a one-time thing. People need something to help them throughout this entire mess.

UBI could possibly be the worst idea ever, and is the exact opposite of the ethos that built this country. With roughly a 3.5% unemployment rate there is no excuse to not work.
I said that unemployment will rise, wages will do the same thing they have been for a few years. You said it'll depend on the reason. My reason is demand will fall. To be clear: I think unemployment will rise because of falling demand.

Yep. Am running out on my Unemployment, still can't drive, cuz I fixed the car instead and am 2,000 bucks behind on the rent. And I only have 2,500 left of unemployment. Am gonna be homeless. Can't find a job.
They're happy because this gives them just one more reason to be nationalistic, xenophobic, and strangely patriotic for a country with a 9.7% unemployment rate.
So you are going to insure ALL workers have access to paid sick time? That people who can’t work because of this get unemployment? That everyone can get tested and treated at no charge? That kids who rely on school lunches get fed? Support UBI?
This would help displaced workers who were actually in search of jobs when all this occurred. Many who are not receiving unemployment benefits.
That's unfortunate. Not sure if you have unemployment they cut the waiting week here IN ny if affected by covid19. Keep the faith and good luck

Inland Unemployment Rate Rises In Early 2020 http://dlvr.it/RRvDJC
I’ve heard you can apply for unemployment for lost wages if your job closes or cuts hours due to the virus. But I’ve also heard it takes 3 weeks to kick in. Best of luck to you guys
Bail out plan will achieve nothing. 50%+ of U.S. will be in lock down by midweek. This will trigger more than Recession. Unemployment will hit Depression levels. GDP will be anemic. Every small/local business at risk of bankruptcy # depression # unemployment # StockMarketCrash2020
5. Provide a job guarantee for unemployed workers, that cushions the impact on unemployment and provides us with a pool of workers to provide essential care (packaging and delivering food/supplies to people in self-isolation, supporting frontline healthcare workers etc.)

With all the advances in AI and robotics, and increasing unemployment , it is time for # UBI at # LivingWage level for everyone, working or not.
@ SenatorLoeffler I’m a Georgia business owner and I want you to understand that the House bill would likely help destroy my business and lead to the unemployment of my people. Two weeks of sick leave if we are shut down would be ~$300k of payroll and no revenue. All jobs lost.
So the company doesnt directly pay into the unemployment they pay an unemployment tax. Which is insured federally and in most cases through the state also no matter what happens you will be taken care of.
What I don’t get is they shut stuff down but don’t say we can claim unemployment right away while we are home because daycare is closed. I feel it will be announced soon because more things are coming this week
No it doesn't - Testing, Stamps, Snap, Sick leave, unemployment, Tri-Care and Government insurance no deductible. Money to special interest-100+ pg
There's a reason unemployment is lowest it's been in years. Trump is a businessman. He knows how economics work. He fights for US.
He is incompetent. We could have used this money healthcare for everyone, prop up small businesses, research a cure for the coronavirus, extend unemployment. Instead he wastes on the stock market that he can’t control just because of his greed. # TyphoidTrumphttps://twitter.com/RingOfFireMedia/status/1238781924644024320 …

Since Friday there are 20 cases in her area. Her place of business has closed indefinitely. They have no timeline for when they can come back to work and no idea when their next pay check will come. They are not being advised on how to collect unemployment. 4/9
The Clippers, Lakers, Kings, and Staples Center are paying more than 2,800 hourly employees as the arena shuts down. If you do the math, that'll end up being in the millions of dollars with all of the missed games. I had a lot of worried friends thinking they'd need unemployment
LIAR. It gives free testing and treatment to EVERYBODY in the US. That’s a huge deal. And paid sick and extended unemployment benefits. You were saying??
you can file an unemployment insurance (ui) claim to get partial wage replacement benefit payments since they reduced your hours!! (if you want)
If you're referring to unemployment, it's only 26 weeks normally, not 99 weeks. That was an extension after the recession last time of 73 weeks. And unemployment is only a fraction of what you earned. Many people barely get by working.
Daman should not drop off unemployed from coverage for another six months and replace family allowances with unemployment insurance that would target a percentage of income lost.
It’s disgusting making all these businesses go bust unemployment goes through the roof suicides increase and homes repossessed for a virus that impacts only 5% of us!

President Trump , Is there a provision for Tipped employees, who’s business is shut down due to Covid -19 . Is there going to be a Financial bailout for businesses ? Most Tipped employees don’t qualify for unemployment . NYC Broadway shows are shut down !
Bar I work at told me to keep coming in so they dont have to pay unemployment
I see you didn't mention that the gov't will be paying sick leave for employees of small businesses, extending unemployment, snap, mandating that testing is free to ALL of us. You also failed to mention that 86% of employees at those large companies already have sick leave.
I am a sports photographer that works on commission and sales. No sports, no phoyos equals no pay. But power, rent, phone, food still due. Self employed so no help from unemployment.

Your neighbors should both go file for unemployment benefits.
@ RepAOC says the Wuhan Coronavirus relief bill didn’t go far enough. Wants cash money for all Americans. Doesn’t anyone put away a few bucks for emergencies anymore? This virus isn’t the government’s or the taxpayers fault. People out of work can get unemployment.
It is interesting that many of the ideas "promoted by his ignorant supporters" are being discussed in part by Congress right now to help during the pandemic. Paid family and medical leave, unemployment insurance, and free testing and possibly treatment for COVID19.
U6 unemployment rate is more extensive than the one used in statista and U6 unemployment rate is 15% in Finland. 860,000 Finns live under Finnish poverty line which is around €1000.

@ SenatorBurr @ SenThomTillis Please vote for the House coronavirus bill. It protects people most in need & includes immediate paid sick leave, unemployment insurance, nutrition aid, more Medicaid funds for states, free testing/treatment, protections for health care/other workers

Thanks, I was too lazy to search it up. I'm sorry to hear that you just were laid off. Did you apply for unemployment yet? As if you are eligible for either disability or unemployment benefits there might be a workaround for this.
Don’t blame other people for your choices, seems the unemployment rate is low.

You realise not one single labour government has ever left office with lower national debt and unemployment then when they started? Two if the biggest markers for a civilised society. There is a reason market's crash when labour historically gets voted in.
File for the unemployment shit
Over a quarter of all of todays jobs are redundant bullshit jobs that exist only to lessen unemployment, which in itself is only a problem because of the core capitalist ideals that rules modern society & is slowly & surely leading to our downfall. PS: All those corps are evil.
Just wondering, as a sole proprietor of a small business do I get any help from the government? Since I cannot file for unemployment or other benefits if I am forced to close my business due to the Coronavirus? If I don’t work I get any income.
I’m recording lectures for my classes moved online & fear that I am paving my own road to future unemployment.

Of course. I'm a single mom of a 5 year old girl with type 1 diabetes. Last year I was fired from my job after taking time off to care for her in the hospital and was unemployed for 3 months. I'm still digging my way out so the idea of unemployment again really stresses me out.
I am one of the lucky ones. My self induced quarantine is happening during my seasonal lay off period. I manage w. prudent budgeting & limited unemployment insurance. My heart goes out to those who will be missing paychecks soon.
Large areas of the economy are going to go bust, unemployment will increase dramatically and we are in for a very serious recession. Worryingly the chancellor just last Wednesday seemed not to notice and produced his fantasy budget. No point bailing out airlines as yet.

lmao so my boss called me this morning saying that all locations are temporarily closing as of tonight and they're not sure for how long and that we should file for unemployment:)) we love being jobless
If you work more than 40 hours a week apply for unemployment. I’m out of a job for two + weeks rn possibly more lol, could be worse
Anna, what about those of us who are self employed/independent contractors? We don’t qualify for unemployment. I’m a one person hair salon, what happens when I lose my whole business?
Totally agree. People are not informed. When we have downturn in the economy,like now, wages fall and unemployment increases. More people are eligible for SNAP and all that money goes right back into the economy immediately after it's received. It's benefits the economy!
The newly jobless are applying for unemployment benefits and wondering about their health care. "It just keeps getting worse," one worker said. http://huffp.st/mLERghW
Why haven't we made those cars our state official cars ? We won't, they are Nigerian made. But when that kind of company folds, we will be talking about unemployment. Nigerian designers design African wears for our celebrities to look African, you say shit .......
Most of us *should* be able to apply for unemployment, at least I think so in theory. however it may wait until after the quarantine to be paid, because slow clerical work. But there is at the very least a mandatory 2 days sick leave for anyone concerned regardless.
Sometimes in some states layoffs are better than reduced shifts. It allows employees to collect unemployment. For example, New York waived their 7 day waiting period for unemployment for people laid off because of corona virus.
where are your facts that 50000 people die for every percentile increase to unemployment?
You mean no action (because it was a hoax) then inadequate action (because he is incompetent)! Better start looking for a new job soon cause your fat ass will be on the unemployment line soon!!
Assuming we have entered recession means recovery won't begin until October at the earliest. But it is Kushner’s economy now, so I think we will see at least a full year of declining GDP, increasing unemployment, inflation, and hair-trigger stock prices. And worse, much worse...

Chris we had some pubs and restaurants close temporarily in my city. They decided to do it themselves. Government didn't order it. Unemployment will rise for a short while as we work to get rid of this virus.
Ps if this keeps burning and they keep shutting down economies then Spain won't be far behind - it's banks are a mess - it's also got sky high unemployment and it's internally utterly fractured
Payroll cut does not help gig economy nor on demand hourly workers. The former won’t even be eligible for unemployment. Helicopter money/UBI call it what you want but the structure of labor has changed significantly in 12 years and what worked before not going to work now.
However they still want you to come in for appointments but I doubt that would be required now bc of the obvious reason for unemployment to begin with.
And in Nevada they do get the file for unemployment under such circumstances
It’s not just the workers in local restaurants that need help, the small business owners may not be able to stay in business. We have a small business doing painting & remodeling and hope that we can find clients that want us in their home. We don’t get sick leave or unemployment

This is unprecedented and is the entire industry not just one badly managed company. It would cost probably just as much in unemployment costs and lost taxes if the entire industry goes to the wall, which could happen.
Nothing bums me out more than people getting mad at poor people for unemployment/disability, but not being mad at billionaires holding off shore accounts, or tax loopholes.
nobody has to do that. Its what unemployment insurance is for.
We’ll require decade of expansionary fiscal stimulus to rebuild the economy, and bring unemployment down to an acceptable level. Represents opportunity to reorientate and modernize our economy, to transition it to renewables, and to deliver productivity-enhancing infrastructure
It is legal - and unfortunately furloughing keeps the company from needing to pay out severance like if they fired them outright. Usually they should be able to keep benefits and apply for unemployment.

These past few days have been heart breaking hearing stories of people who have been laid off. They truly don’t know what to do bc their employers refuse to guarantee them a job in the future but also don’t let them collect unemployment. This is why we need a social safety net!
let them go to the unemployment line like everybody else.
Women are the greatest threat in the USA . Fake News claims complete and total phony "unemployment" is worse. So much FAKE NEWS!
Maybe someone could work with the governors office to waive the 7 Day waiting period for unemployment benefits. Would be a big help to those being laid off.

ALL employees that fit the “no sick pay” category should go to work and DO NOTHING. Sit around, knock stuff off the shelves, be rude to customers and managers—GET YOURSELF FIRED!!! Then, unemployment pay will kick in for long enough to cover the home isolation period.

Bush left the White House with unemployment at 8% and rising. The stock market had collapsed. GDP growth was -5.4%. Consumer confidence was 37%. Because of all that, Obama spent most of his two terms repairing the damage. Also, Iraq. There's plenty to blame him for.
Don Lemmon and Brian Stelter. AOC saying it was racist to not eat at Chinese restaurant then telling people not to crowd into restaurants. I believe they want rampant unemployment to push universal basic and student loan forgiveness.

If he did have it they wouldn’t tell us anyway. The stock market would crash. He’s an elderly man who might not last long if he has it. I’ll wait and see because trump and his goonies are all liars.
Go buy @ Google stock, I bet it won’t disappoint when the market goes back up.
No he doesn’t ONLY care about the stock market. Stop being so dramatic. He can care about both the health & financial well-being of Americans at the same time. The only sociopaths are the Twitter bots cheering on this virus to get at Trump

This should have been back in January when he knew how infectious and dangerous this virus instead of calling it a hoax to downplay it to keep the stock market and his hopes for re-election from tanking. But now here we are, and it’s already spiraling out of control nationwide.

Does she not know that the stock market is a representation of the health of business in the US. As it is the investment into industries & all of the supporting, non government, parts that make up our economy & that that affects the rest of the world economies too? Dumb question
Ordering the Fed to dilute the dollar with 1.5 TRILLION dollar injections, and imploding our economy all in the name of preventing the stock market from taking an exhale. The inflation that results from this pump is going to ruin the country far more than COVID19.
Out of the 3 POTUS candidates, @ BernieSanders is the only one in the midst of the # CoronaOutbreak that keeps talking about how we need to take care of our most vulnerable - the sick, the homeless, the elderly, children... People must come before the stock market. # FiresideChat
This in turn has caused the stock market to nosedive for reasons best known to the money jugglers.

eh? I dunno, probably could do it for less than 100 million / km easy. so 556 billion. ish. Def. in the realm of possibility. The Fed just dropped 3x that into the stock market and it dissapeared in an hour.
the coronavirus has not only been affecting everyday life, but it has greatly affected the stock market.
Because you said you rather he die/be half-dead than that happening (if I'm not mistaken). That's stupid because of the panic it would cause in the country & in the stock market/economy as well.
How convenient. He also didn’t disband the CDC pandemic squad or calm the stock market fears, so... shrug.
Given the events in the stock market over the last 2 weeks, it was a big deal & there's great reason why he would post that. This tumble in the market is fear based only. Finally having a huge uptick day was critical for smoothing it out a bit. Stop your hatred & support instead.

Panic Buying in Supermarkets, Panic Selling in Stock Markets.. only in the good ol' U.S. of A
The coronavirus hits. Stock markets plummet. Boris Johnson and Trump make refusing to act into their action. Two male archetypes weathering the storm - William Dafoe and Robert Pattinson stuck in a lighthouse. Keep Calm and Carry On - a very masculine proposition.

He really thinks the stock market is only about him. I wish he would put as much enthusiasm in keeping everyone healthy.
For Pi Day (14th March), I watched Pi (the film). It’s about patterns and interconnectedness. It’s about a stock market crash. Currently the stock market’s crashing. This month I’ve watched a lot of black and white art films: The Lighthouse, Bait, Tetsuo the Iron Man, Pi.

Forgetting of course about the stock market bloodbath the part two weeks
This is proven by @ stevenmnuchin1’s presence at a pandemic presser. I muted it, but I’m pretty sure Trump invited him to talk about economic stimuli to boost his precious stock market indicators.
Wow. The stock market recovered 2/3 of its recent losses. In other words, the # impeached president wants praise for the stock market losses being only medium, not large. What hypocrisy. Yet, his # MAGA lemmings fall for his deceptive narratives. @ realDonaldTrump # economy # COVID19
Now that Trump does not have the stock market to brag about, he is floundering like a porn star who lost his dick.

Delays in shutting down schools is to blunt the impact on businesses. How about consideration for the families that have school aged children. UCP has none. They are only worried about the cost to business profits.
And the bracket parties in the office Monday, essentially shutting down business...
You are sick I mean very sick. The agency is a product of law shutting down a business that was established and strived on apartheid policy is within the operations of the agency. I am really ashamed of you. Olodo eru owo
Thank you. I happen to feel the same, so does my rhuematologist & pulmonologist. I tend to put others first, say “I’m fine”, but I have my little boy to think of, I can’t risk it. Unfortunately now, I’m quarantining myself, shutting my business down, making no money for 3 weeks.
My work is still continuing. My fiancees work is still going. My mum, who is at significant risk, her work is still going. I've not heard of a single business shutting shop but people are intent on the NRL grinding to a halt.
Excellent guide to helping convince your small business owner boss, who is understandably very worried about the future, why shutting down temporarily is the best thing for society, employees, and the business https://twitter.com/NateDuncanNBA/status/1238974418639941632 …
And shutting down business people will have no money to spend at ‘essential’ stores. Schools have closed now for weeks. Most Americans don’t even have a weeks worth of savings in the bank. Their retirement 401ks just took a bigger hit than the 2008 crisis.

She is a moron, anyone unemployed by no fault of their own, ie a business shutting down for a month due to Coronavirus would be eligible for unemployment insurance. Universities are accommodating students who can not go home. She is an assclown, making this about her agenda!
If we’re serious about shutting down for several weeks then SME’s need to be offered interest free business loans and relief on rates to cover them. Halting some events doesn’t nullify spread of Coronavirus when everything else carries on. Employees need business’s to return to
france shutting down cafes? sh$t got real

The world is shutting. Amazing. At this point u are right. They should suspend also markets until world business opens again.
With @ uvic shutting down, there are now a bundle of experts out of the economics, public administration, and business who I'm sure would be happy to offer their expertise to council. We need governments to act quickly, but only as quickly as it takes to get the policy right.

Drove through downtown Nashville earlier. People on pedal taverns and on the party buses, in and out of honky tonks. Business as usual. Everyone seems to waiting for some astronomical number rather than shutting it down to stop it from GETTING TO that number. @ JohnCooper4Nash
If people and business will not voluntarily adhere to social distancing , then it is for the Government to direct the shutting of pubs.
Man if I were still in high school right now I’d be having the time of my life with all this shutting down school business and stuff

None of you in the “better safe than sorry” crowd considered the consequences of shutting down society. I’m walking around NYC right now, “patroning” bars and restaurants that are desperate for business
My city was about the only town in CA not shutting schools down until 2 corona cases popped up here in snobville...now the entire city is closing for business.

That’s wild. Temperance Beer Co in Evanston is keeping up business by shutting doors but doing drive thru purchase, having staff wear surgical gloves, differentiating staff who take cards vs who deliver beer, and spraying cans with isopropyl alcohol before delivery.
People dying, 401k’s losing value, business and everything else shutting down, but you, you’re funny. Like a heart attack. Here’s the problem: you were elected to be a leader, not an unfunny comedian. You’re terrible at the former and excel at the latter. PS: that beer sucks.
Entire fucking countries are shutting down and all my company's bosses care about is "continuity of business." The US is so fucked.
I was thankfully able to get my laptop fixed, so I will be writing more. Fortunately, I was able to get it fixed with this Covid-19 crisis. There’s been a state of emergency where I live, and there’s talk of shutting the city down, closing stores and business. It’s crazy.
Agree, there’s Ireland shutting everything down pretty much and we’re just business as usual, and to think if it hadn’t been for the PL Corona cases there’d have been 50,000+ descending upon Glasgow tomorrow
So every business in Australia right now is sending emails saying “we don’t want corona virus but shutting down and going bankrupt is spookier so we are cleaning everything all the time instead.” Hell yeah recession is the worst
I'm not worried either to be honest. It's just odd to see everyone else shutting down while my office is business as usual.
Can they ignore $ TSLA literally shutting down along with every other business - that’s what’s happening in Europe right now due to # covid19. As in being unable to deliver cars ( $ TSLA end of Q push coning up) because of mandated shutdowns. See my other tweets for details.

3) haven’t worked for a month because the children are off school. It would seem that the most vulnerable and those who need the most care don’t work so surely we need to keep the wheels of business in motion and let the NHS focus on the elderly and vulnerable. Shutting down
2)2 weeks off work . So each business , large or small, will have to manage 2 weeks sick leave pp be it staggered or if they all get it together, a shutdown for 2 weeks. If children don’t get it so bad why are we considering shutting down schools. I know of people in Italy who

I think Bernie's federal jobs program would be a catastrophe! Everyone is trying to deny responsibility for Covid-19, but the CDC definitely dropped the ball... No test kits, no vaccine, people are staying home and business shutting down. LA has a dark, foreboding feeling.

Doubt this is different anywhere else unfortunately. Countries are shutting down, but unless your business is closed, or you've been told to quarantine, it seems getting paid if you choose to isolate or look after children very much depends on the goodwill of employers.

I would still go to a small business, not really a big risk at this point. Shutting down the larger events like sports, conferences, schools will cause some pain, but failing to do so could cause much more. What will this look like in 2 or 3 months if we don't? pic.twitter.com/lG331pkGTJ
idk, it's most likely bc shutting down the whole country is bad for business and eu is conestantly saying quarantining everyone is inhumane and idk but mostly money
What I’m learning about this Coronavirus is that corporations are still about their business and hitting their numbers by any means. If a larger authority isn’t shutting them down, your attendance will be required. # SocialDistancingBeDamned
This is big! The world most profitable company shutting down. This suggest how serious a hit the economy & business will be.

After spending Thursday panicking about work shutting down, on Friday my students were great. Cooperative, business as usual, no trouble. Then my boss & I held my 6mo evaluation meeting as scheduled and she gave me a glowing review. It was affirmation I really needed right then.
In a nation of 330 million - most of whom depend on small business to live - are we thinking through the ramifications of shutting everything down? We aren’t, and when everyone calms down this will be the real catastrophe. https://twitter.com/Peggynoonannyc/status/1238550887724916737 …
But the govt are basically advocating business as usual. It’s employers and event organizers who have led on shutting things down. No one is suggesting a couple of weeks of school closures will fix this
shout out to 'heroic' small business owners like tom douglas and ethan stowell for immediately shutting down their mediocre, wage-thieving restaurant empires, fucking over their many employees, and showing their paper thin committment to the community fuck you choke on your food
What a disaster in Australia. Too many business will be shutting down on Monday, too many people will be affected on they income. :(
Agreed. The city seems to be shutting down and yet our directive is business as usual. What a great idea, hundreds if not thousands of people in government buildings. Good idea!
Shutting it down would be bad for business
through public school systems. In addition to those obstacle, without shutting down business and industry parents who NEED to work must figure out childcare. Careful Planning for the safety and security of America’s children must be done locally first...
This business of shutting everything will not work ,adopt the UK approach, give correct advise,protect susceptible groups and let people build immunity,there is no quick fix!

Yeah I’m honestly getting grossed out by the brands using this as some sort of way to connect to customers.... it’s one thing if you have a business that can help or is shutting down, but otherwise, take a seat please
It's a measure to avoid market panicking. I don't think stock markets are equivalent to other business. In fact, temporary halts are happening these days multiple times per session since shutting down is a natural mechanism of the markets. e.g.: https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/12/covid-19-market-turmoil-tests-nyses-shutdown-circuit-breakers/ …
oh shit it's literally just business as usual in the UK, they're not shutting anything down or doing any testing, not even hospital patients. I'm glad they're alt least doing something for you
LISTEN UP PLEASE BUY gift cards to your favorite local business, tip restaurant servers triple, ask what you can do. The service industry is shutting down, cutting hours, letting people go; especially in downtown + areas not surrounded by people WFH.
I'm from America, but in my state they shut down every single school, and they're about to start shutting down business's.
As governments and business are shutting down across the country— ACORN members demand: - a Freeze on all Evictions. - People who are employed precariously and need to self isolate or lose their jobs need to be able to access EI!
@ narendramodi @ PMOIndia And also I feel this is better solution than closing or shutting business down for days or weeks.
spreading fear isn’t going to help anyone. please don’t start or spread things that haven’t happened yet. we don’t need more anxiety during this time and usps ‘shutting down’ would hurt us all! artists- keep creating! small business supporters- keep supporting!
Lots of hate filled lefty Biden supporters here. For help with Coronavirus and TDS and try Fox News or Fox Business Your heart is filled with hate to say; "Thank-you for all your efforts Mr. President!" Thank-you for the lives you have saved shutting boards fast Trump 2020
What about all the shared housing, hospitals, care homes, public transport, etc ?! You need to get down in legislation that business bosses (sporting & not) who are NOW shutting down should be fined, they will be responsible for many, many people losing their jobs/businesses etc.
How do I get government to cover to get paid leave for my small business? Small business won’t survive shutting things down and mass hysteria. Where is my handout or will only the mega corporations get the bailout again?
My husband and I run a small restaurant and are very worried about business shutting down. We also have a disabled child at special needs school. I’d rather the most vulnerable kids in society were protected. Lots of people are going to be hit hard in various ways.
Interesting. Covid is going to impact on sales anyway, so minimising costs of store sites by shuttering may be a practical business move. Shutting the website isn't, though.
With the government’s shutting down the the state, I would like to request @ narendramodi @ nsitharam @ bsybjp to kindly give a exemption on loan repayments for the next three months as the roadside # vendors, # taxi drivers & # small business owners are facing severe crisis.
We're in a shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted situation. Obviously the safety of students and staff takes priority, so cancelling face to face contact is right. But to pretend that its business as usual is disingenuous. I think we should cancel all teaching /1
Exactly. I was stunned yesterday to receive an email from a UK department that included the phrase "business as usual". Meanwhile my country is shutting borders and reading drive through testing sites.
Govt is making people stay and shutting down business. Therefore they should making arrangements to solve the ramifications of those orders. Yes?
People complaining how their colleges are shutting down and they weren’t allowed to take online before all this. Like they offer whatever the fuck they want. It’s a business and you have a choice to purchase from them or not

1 but 10 on the UK shutting down and ruining my business and bankrupting me
So very true. I find it ironic that the Fed has talked much of the private sector into shutting down while come Monday morning it will be business as usual for many Fed Agencies. As you have said, Pure Politics.
U.K. # COVID19 plan seems to be all about tweaking the infection rate over time. BUT it seems to me that ’Business’ has gone all in; shutting down in many ways. Cannot see how Gov can tweak 90% BAU, then a bit of 70% BAU. Smoothing human behaviour is not possible?
I find it to be a win-win situation. I get to watch Frozen 2 at home much earlier than planned and they get some good business. I don’t blame them, as massive as a company as they are, shutting down parks and movie production and releases is gonna hurt
We never wanted this to happen. China has been shutting down as a country for months, risking its economy for the sake of rest of the world. What if the next pandemic outbreak first occurs in India? Stop blaming and take precautions ASAP, you’ll need it.
What **is** essential is blunting the peak. If evidence shows closing things down now will do that, they probably want closing down now. Without evidence - shutting down life & business is just adding more harm to a harmful situation.

There are no treatments for CV-19, unlike the flu which has several treatment options and a vaccine. I agree, panic does no good to anyone, but shutting down the country to avert the spread of something that seems to wreak havoc on those older than 60, seems legit to me!

The last 3 words of my tweet are "slow it down". We have literally done nothing to slow it down. We haven't closed schools, limited travel, etc. It is business as usual. And shutting down sporting events is hardly shutting the country down or damaging the economy.

My fellow business owners that depend on vendors who are shutting businesses down because of the corona virus.... I feel for you and stand with you
Huge diff now is this isn't part of a business cycle nor a financial crisis. This is a few hundred mil people not going to work (or dying,) govs shutting down core infra, LOTS of businesses going bust & the knock-on impact. Not easily fixed with increased liq or stimulus spending
I work for capitalism so the chances of my work actually shutting down due to a virus outbreak are incredibly slim. We've had riots and flooding and that still didn't stop the store from carrying on the business. I'm not even joking.

@ TheJusticeDept Bill Barr is Trump's new fixer by shutting down the hush money investigation into Trump and his family business. The truth will come out and Bill Barr will go to jail just like Michael Cohen. Most Trump Cronies do go to jail.
Not sure how that works in the long run, I suggest shutting down everything (probably too late) deal with the virus, then back to work and controlled borders. Shutting down one or two business does nothing to stop the spread of the virus.

Constant economic growth as pertaining to what? As pertaining to a country’s GDP? Businesses themselves? I don’t even really agree with your premise tbh.
A national quarantine will do more economic and social damage to our actual labor force that generates our GDP than simply allowing covid-19 to run rampant. Its bad from both a progressive (hurts the economically vulnerable, which is most of US) and conservative (business) view

You listen to a left wing Bernie sanders that has supported Venezuela and Cuba. Venezuela had top 5 gdp for years now they are suffering all their companies leaving due to high ass taxes so the middle class suffers now and can’t even get food water or medical care now
I appreciate issues regarding schools and NHS staffing, and the global health issues associated with loss of GDP. What kills me is any mention of herd immunity. This is not something to aim for in this context.
Also, Japan has a 234% debt to GDP ratio and still has universal healthcare.
GDP will tank for the 1st quarter. Will be huge 2nd and 3rd!! Extent of replenishment manufacturing and massive government aid spending won't kick in until April/May
I wouldn't be worrying about GDP, I think that's a bit screwed at this point. As for herd immunity smh
But it would be preferable to rubbing alcohol, oooooouch!

Global GDP tests positive for Coronavirus, is a negative GDP already priced ??
It depends on what you prioritise, GDP growth vs a domestic population that feels it can achieve the American dream. We have a lot of discontent in Australia because of this. Appreciate the open spirit of the conversation, refreshing on Twitter.
US health care consumes 18% of GDP, but only has hospital beds for 0.28% of people. Not a great tooth-to-tail ratio. But war experience shows you can add more teeth rapidly with intelligent leadership.
Try telling that to @ BorisJohnson, he won't shut schools because the economy would lose 3% GDP, tell me how this isn't politics!
Per-capita GDP is more likely to contribute longer life expectancy, not there other way around. Also, neither of these things are independent variables.
# Boris will always put ECONOMY before HUMANITY. Last year, he called child abuse inquiries a 'waste of money' and now he's not closing schools to stop the virus because it will take out 3% of the UK GDP. He might not have # COVID19, but there is one thing he's infected with: EVIL.
He studied in Russia, he’s driving a Mercedes, and EBLA in Ghana received over 3 times Ghana’s GDP.
The region first hit in italy has a greater gdp than most regions in either usa or eu. So matching standards

The Federal Reserve just printed $1.5 trillion. For perspective, the nation's entire GDP is $21 trillion. Think about that. They just printed 7% of the ENTIRE GDP and injected it into the banking repo market in. a. single. day.
The U.S. Federal Reserve announced earlier this week that they are pumping $1.5 Trillion in market repo operations. The US's entire GDP is $21 Trillion, so they just committed 7% of the ENTIRE nation's GDP to the banking repo market. In a single day. Let that sink in.
Nothing gets in the way of GDP. Keep the dollars rolling in, keep spending and keep going to events.
This important. Mortality is affected by latitude and GDP. No accident the breakouts are in the same latitude Band Between Seattle and NY. See how FL does. Almost all of Europe is in the band for the most infections/deaths.

Stronger social distancing measures will buy us time to study the coronavirus, develop treatments, and ultimately generate a vaccine. Yes, there'll be a GDP impact, but this can be mitigated through careful planning & sustained fiscal intervention. Lives matter more than GDP.
How much cut in GDP is justified to delay an infection that has say 1% mortality? (Or 0.2% as in France and Germany)?
BIS also reported global USD shortage of $15tril, thats 70% of US GDP. So bullish on $ DXY now?
Some of us measure growth differently. Some by the GDP, and other by the prosperity of all. Capitalism has done well in place of feudalism and slave labor systems, and like all systems before there's a time to outgrow them. Every existing system had those who defended it.

Notvtrue. Trump says it is and that's why you believe it. He promised real GDP growth of 4-6% per year, but only achieved 2.9% growth in 2018, the same rate as 2015.

Definitely part of it: less work = lower productivity = lower GDP
70% of the total economy, of the GDP of the country. I don't find the sense of that argument since if you own 70% of the things that make my life possible you still own most of the things that make my life possible and more than what I do own.

I know exactly what I am talking about. You have a GDP of 202 Billion - 5% of the entire UK, which is already small. We are self sufficient. You are not. We do have paid sick leave, whether that be private of federal employees. It is you that doesn't have a clue.
On a GDP of $2.7 trillion, when the Indian Parliament abrogated Article 370, the sole voice that condemned it in the United Nations Security Council was Chinas, points out Gautam Chikermane: http://ow.ly/7VQn30qpOr2
This is ludicrous and scare mongering at it's worse. GDP per capita / health correlations don't relate to one off shocks resulting from new diseases, these represent the outcome of decades of under investment in health and education. Little connection with the current crisis.
US is running on vapour, it has been doing so for a while. How can you have guns, butter and wars & more guns? US debt to GDP ratio is a novel one. You asked the right question; US government pays the banks then pays the interest on the money that it has paid the banks too.

The private sector is twice as expensive as a percentage of GDP and delivers worse results - maybe instead of hugging onto the private sector as though it were some sacred deity that requires human sacrifices, how about educating yourself on the subject matter of which you speak.

We’re just being extra careful to surpress that growing fat tail risk of America facing mass gravesites. Well worth the dip in Q1 GDP that will largely be made up for with the bump in Q2, if we can do this shutdown + social distancing properly. It makes economic and social sense.
This buy the dip mentality, or the idea that it’s a 3 week bear market will damage so many people. The world is about to take a huge GDP hit the likes none of us have ever seen. There‘ll be a great buying opportunity one day, just sadly not anytime soon nor even maybe this year.
Yeah, not per capita GDP. Nobody really cares about the fantastic output of Qatar, Macao and Luxembourg. Military size is probably a more relevant metric, but less inspiring.
When gov't borrowing comes up for public discussion in Canada, one argument that we often hear is that Canada's debt-to-GDP ratio is healthy. A figure of 35% or similar is trotted out. Is this argument valid? I take a look at this in my latest article: http://darshanmaharaja.ca/all-under-one-roof/ …

Damn hazmat Apocalyptic Barbie. First laugh in weeks.
the word "depression" bundles together two dimensions. A depression is a recession + the subsequent recovery period when GDP is lower than potential. But the "recession" portion has to be especially severe because depression also means "recession but worse"
Africa as a country take a look of this, Business owners will have a market of 1.2 Billion people, Musicians will get more fans,streams,views. Airplanes will increase their revenues due to easy access of Airports and tickets, Higher GDP growth, Government will collect more taxes.

You can't separate them, GDP and health outcomes are linked inextricably, doesn't matter which one is first affected or for what reasons, the other will follow... it's a Catch 22
On the other hand, over the next few months the UK shifted, what, 2-3% of GDP towards the war. If we did that for public health now we'd have half a million ventilators by autumn.

No, they didn't handle it better than any country. The politboro lied, censored, downplayed, and misdirected since at least November 17th to protect muh GDP. Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, and South Korea are the models for dealing with this.
That doesn't explain why the GDP is plummeting against almost every currency in the world. If it was just crashing against the USD then maybe you'd be on to something. There must be some other explanation as to why nobody has any confidence in Brexit Britain.

But US military spending vastly outpaces its GDP growth at a higher rate than China, even assuming their falls over time. The McCoy stuff discusses much of this. Also space warfare investment is complementary to other things & industries.

200bn loss in GDP? Clutching straws I think. You can’t meassure what never was. Besides the EU continues its economic slowdown, the U.K. will in the long run benefit from being a normal country able to make its own trade deals. EU is an ever shrinking % of world economy. Fact.

CMS predicts with current US system healthcare will cost 19.4% of GDP by 2027. Current Medicare costs rise slower than the current private sector healthcare costs & have higher user satisfaction rating. Other developed nations cover everyone, 40-65% of cost, better outcomes. 2/2
Repo is a monetary tool. However, $3 trillion of fed spending on infrastructure, health and education would easily get you very high GDP growth (see the last 30 years in China for example).
To put this in context – that’d be €40 billion in Germany or €160 billion in the US, relative to GDP.

Unprecedented is right, Market growth, 1000 points less per year than Obama, less jobs created per year than Obama, and less GDP growth than Obama, way to go gang.
Assuming we have entered recession means recovery won't begin until October at the earliest. But it is Kushner’s economy now, so I think we will see at least a full year of declining GDP, increasing unemployment, inflation, and hair-trigger stock prices. And worse, much worse...

Truman and Kennedy are the only reason that there is that statistic, and in Truman’s case it makes sense as the Cold War led to the US becoming a industrial powerhouse leading to the GDP growing much faster. However this isn’t the Cold War; the economy has changed.

Andrew Yang is foreshadowing an economy where Joe Biden is president. Remember the less than 1% gdp. Mr. Yang don't worry. President Trump will be re-elected and continue to grow the economy. This to shall pass like H1N1.
So since 2009, all governments (Golding, PSM & Holness) have tightened their belt due to necessity. They had cut back on spending significantly so we could get help from the IMF and we could pay down our debt. Our debt dropped from ~150% of GDP to approaching 90% by March 31, ‘20
Bush left the White House with unemployment at 8% and rising. The stock market had collapsed. GDP growth was -5.4%. Consumer confidence was 37%. Because of all that, Obama spent most of his two terms repairing the damage. Also, Iraq. There's plenty to blame him for.
The market have been up ~20% for a few years. Was GDP up that much? Is it JUST possible that things were already overvalued? And price discovery hasn't truly happened yet?

Don't try to be clever. There's no $ tag on expanding the ACA. We do know currently the US spends around $3.5 Trillion (17.5 % of GDP) with federal and state picking up 40% of that including the most expensive cohorts in the population. 1/?
You are not getting the GDP is the size of the economy not the purchasing power or well being part
GDP growth out of the 2008 recession was the slowest ever recorded (2.6%, 1.6%, 2.2%, 1.8% for 2010-2013) relative to any previous recession - including the Great Depression. ACA weighed down small biz recovery. Dodd-Frank killed community banks - big banks got bigger.

December quarter GDP exceeded expectations. Full time employment was growing. Seems like he is doing his job.
Floridians living off their retirement accounts will be very upset with Trump delivering market losses again in 2020, worse than 2018. 2019 saw lots of gains, but not enough to make up for two years of losses and a recession. (Obama went 8/8 years of stocks & GDP rising steady.)

Following the criticism from the most respectable scientists on the planet, we have been forced to see the new data showing that what we call epidemic's actually a "pandemic" which will be lethal for elderly and most vulnerable people. We decide that lives are worth more than GDP
They’re worth a grand total of nothing to to the GDP and the hedge fund types so who cares
hopefully we get to proper actual helicopter money from central banks (not just govt's cutting cheques) before too long. policy approach in G7 improved in latter part of last week but is still going to fall short of what's needed; GDP loss is unimagineable.

If you have a structural GDP of X, this is not the same as a structural GDP of X + Y which is decreasing by a crisis to X. The health of people is build up in a long period of higher GDP. How should we see this in relation to this picture?

Great use the GDP is for you and your families when grandpa and grandma are dying because the cashier at Walmart who's sick can either go to work or default on his student loans. See you in hell, make it cozy for me.
Fight it big man!!! Fight it with all your worth!
I probably didn't think it was inevitable two weeks ago but I did last weekend. Remember what Howard Marks said. Zero GDP growth means this year is as GOOD as last year. How is that remotely possible now?
Fully agree that GDP is the wrong measure. But socialising losses whilst privatising profits is also wrong. As is shock unemployment and hard working business people losing their life’s work in a few weeks. It’s super-complex and a massive crisis. That’s the point.

Norway has a 4th highest GDP per capita, has the highest development index, the least income inequality, the highest standard of living, and the highest democracy index in the world. The US's rank in those is 11, 15, 56, 10, 25 respectively. So, Norway.
Yes, the ride on our backs in two ways. Our tax payers and healthcare consumers pay for all medical R&D. EU gets it cheap. Can spend less on healtcare. As you say the also spends 1-2% less of GDP on defense bc we pay 3/4 of NATO costs. According to treaty, it should be about half
Because to a Tory, there is actually a choice between GDP and human lives, they think the latter is expendable the former the priority.
Unqualified and unreliable post, please don't quote or use for any official references. Total world GDP in 2019 was $88.89 trillion, of which, Global total assets of banking industry were $124 trillion. Global real estate market size was $8.9 trillion in 2019.
Don’t believe their stats. They bald-faced lie about even their GDP, which the rest of the world is able to independently verify through freight numbers, satellite images, and emissions. Why wouldn’t they lie about this, esp. where they have the upper hand at information control?

Third, the government just likes money? Well I mean they should focus mainly on “money” and the financial sector to help a struggling country and economy grow and develop. Namibia’s GDP PP measured at PPP is less than 10,000 USD, its HDI is 0.645. (2)

Air New Zealand is going to need its own bailout/buyout. That'll cost a pretty penny. Can we afford it? If the Govt is spending say $12b that's only 4% of GDP. This is the rainy day we paid down National's debt for. Like the soft ban at the border, we can't afford not to do it.

A GOOD & NECESSARY READ: The coronavirus is already hurting the world economy. Here’s why it could get really scary. According to a study by the World Bank, a severe pandemic could cause economic losses by nearly 5% of global GDP, or OVER $3 trillion. http://247newsonline.org/the-coronavirus-is-already-hurting-the-world-economy-heres-why-it-could-get-really-scary/ … 04pic.twitter.com/UsurgmYycd

Theyre doing it to save 3% of GDP, this is not for the benefit of the people but for the benefit of the economy. Immunity isn’t guaranteed, they’re gambling with lives. We’re following the same trajectory as Italy if we don’t take those steps now this will only get worse
LOL Did you even recognize the flags? US is not even in the top 5 of GDP per capita (nominal), and not in top 10 if it's PPP

I understand but maximizing health is also not without controversy. There is very often a utility-health trade-off even if one defines health as quality-adjusted life years, which is probably its best measure. I think policy makers should put some weight on both GDP and health.
That's socialism. Look at their GDP and ours. We dont need government in our life. We can do better without government infringing on our freedom.
The Health Minister is an economist. Most survivors of the approaching cataclysm will be those able to add to the GDP of the country.

A one percentage point cut in average personal tax rates in US states would raise real GDP per capita by up to 1.8% over time. Cutting corporate taxes do not lower tax revenue. (Martens and Ravn, 2013) https://economics.mit.edu/files/7666

Please show me the data to support your claims. Not GDP, total household income and a list of 20 highly ranked hospitals. I want an actual study that compares US healthcare to other countries. I'll wait.
Huge. Even if the virus itself turns out to be less than expected, the panic and fear being encouraged by media is already having an impact at retail venues and that will get worse. Consumer spending is ~60% of Canada's GDP and 70% of America's.
That's the same thing you just posted. Those are not healthcare statistics. That's GDP and some rankings of a handful of hospitals. Please show me the data you have that ranks the US #1 overall in healthcare when compared to other countries.

The # mkts have had a 26% decline. Was this enough, given the # COVIDー19 is still spreading(slowly) and the mkts trade forward expectations? If GDP were to go to 0 for the 1/4 (Mar-May), annual DGP would be off 25%. GDP will NOT be 0. Therefore......
Revenue rates are also not the only factor my friend. If tax rates are 50% of revenue in a GDP that is $1 million, is that better than a rate of 25% of revenue in a GDP that is $1 billion? Do you really think people didn’t hire accountants and use off shore tax shelters then?

- preparedness of the health care system: supplies, no. of doctors & nurses on duty etc? - how close are hospitals to being overwhelmed? - ability to carry out tests? How many test kits are there? How many coming? - impact on GDP (some analysts say recession looming)? 3/4
At the moment Spanish tourism is dead - that's 10 - 11% of GDP - plus consumption etc etc - effectively the economy is having a heart attack - so you get control of the numbers - everyone goes back to work - numbers take off again in due course 1/

I was at McDonald’s yesterday and saw a guy walking out of the bathroom without washing his hands after using the toilet. And it was an adult. How some people are even not washing their hands after using the toilet is beyond me!
GDP surely has its place as a tool of economic accounting. I guess I mean to say a better family of measures, where the thing we maximize shouldn’t be GDP per se (nor “the stock market” — pick your favorite index). Something rooted in health, healthiness, life expectancy...
Of course we don't want to maximize GDP right now. That's why I said, we must stop the pandemic. We should just use the indicator wisely, as it gives us probably the best measure of economic costs.

Way too early in game to know what's to happen. If we get a handle, if warmer weather reduces communicability and we have only a mnth of relative economic stagnation, it's 3% of temporarily lost GDP. If we lose a few million people and it takes a few months, it might be 10%

Globally, the 1957 pandemic killed 1.1M people. There was regional variation; for instance: 0.3 deaths/10,000 in Egypt and 9.8/10,000 in Chile. GDP and latitude explained 43% of the variance in excess mortality. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4747626/ … 7/pic.twitter.com/bAC2DnxXMQ

Not useless sure. But also not sufficient. And you certainly don’t want to be maximizing measured GDP right now!
It works in the UK. US GDP spend on healthcare is 17%. UK is %. Socialism is the method by which people get to benefit from their own productivity, rather than just the asset holders.
From memory one of the people in the survey has a GDP fall of 12% at an annual rate in Q2. Which is perfectly plausible.
Take care, the measures will escalate here, but keep an eye for yourself on the patterns and the measures in Europe to compare and remember that the UK gov has shown its priority is saving gdp not lives
Global GDP will shrink for this part of the year. As a result the looming risk of a financial panic and a credit crunch, has led central banks to cut interest rates at a pace last seen in the financial crisis of 2007-09.
d) clear consumption growth e) interest rate cut with drop in inflation f) overall healthy GDP growth I personally feel this was a great chance to counter the slow growth plus corona debacle and give the necessary boost, instead they've tightened the screw
"Given the other ways the crisis will impact the economy, including a broader pull-back in consumer spending, business investment and international trade, GDP will decline in the first quarter of 2020, and decline again in the second quarter.

I mean we can talk about the measures of those surveys if you really want. Government expenditure per GDP is usually the most weighted thing. But how much the government spends on healthcare isn't inherent to the quality. Thats why I think Colombia and Belize scored higher in one
Because politicians are more afraid of the stock market than they are actually worried about people. Just temporarily halting production is a major threat for GDP.
Actually I see the use of GDP as an indicator as a good thing right now. Yes, we must contain the pandemic. But there is economic cost. How large is this cost? Look at the GDP contraction. Since we also know how policy affects GDP, we also know what to do to address these costs.
I don’t blame them though...we are not a healthy country even though our gdp says otherwise.

There is 350% debt to GDP vs 300% debt to GDP the last time they did it. Some differences, some similarities. Grab some popcorn and let's see how it plays out.
Interesting facts: 1. Healthcare budget of India is around 1% of overall GDP. (Population= 133 crores) 2. Healthcare budget of the US is 18% of overall GDP. (Pop= 33 crores) 3. Healthcare budget of the US > Overall GDP of India.
If one wants to guess tourism as % of GDP just imagine the % of people who travel, for how long, multiply by number > 1 bc when ppl travel they do more stuff than they do at home. Eat, sleep, shop for self, shop for others, drive/fly, go to a park/museum/concert.
2) We long for the fruits of leadership under Obama: 1.9% average GDP growth, high unemployment, sky high medical insurance and deductibles, illegal gun running, not shovel ready jobs, nearly 90% of all new jobs part time, increasing disparity of wealth. Yes we miss Obama.
Because the whole world are taking tough decisions to stop the spread including closing borders. Their people are the ONLY priority. In this country, the government it appears are more concerned with GDP figures than public health.
