Are you referring to the economy? Unfortunately, we have Covid, however, it is being rebuilt and quickly.
Better to have a sane and caring human want to partly control the economy on behalf of America than have an incompetent criminal try to possess it on behalf of his crime family.
The economy is most important but we can definitely disagree. Stay safe.

We must first understand the source of the virus. The economy, the stock market, and employment are not important. It is meaningless if the source of the virus is not resolved. At present, the entire world has stopped running, and no one has asked where the virus came from.
A good economy monetizes more and more, a bad economy monetizes less and less. Join @ EverGreenCoin_ so we can monetize plants and water.

Trump did a great job with unemployment rates-I will give him that, he has done decent things in our economy but molester vs pedophile doesn’t sit well with me. At this point, social issues are the BIGGEST issue even with the pandemic. But this has been a circus and why continue?
So we’re killing the economy for this ? Really ?

He piggybacked off a strong economy his predecessor built, and due to his cowardice and incompetence during covid, destroyed it.
Economy roaring back here. The bars are opening and people feel safe to go out and spend money. Why? The infection rate is down. The death rate means nothing. If I was in Florida now I wouldn’t want to go out. Sure the death rate is lower but why take the chance? That’s the prob!
I don’t worship the economy. I worship the One who rescued me.
Yes, because they depended on the US protecting them while they built their economy and became an export powerhouse. Now it's time to step up and pay their dues, but ungrateful Germany doesn't want to. They would rather spend on bailouts and the climate scam.

funny how quickly the pro life crew went from “a single cell is a precious human life” to “we can sacrifice a few thousand children for the sake of our economy”

# ThisIsDeliberate Trump wiped out pandemic protections RIGHT BEFORE having one. Just a coincidence? Trashing our economy by not following CDC & now blocks data to CDC.

Compared to other countries known by inventions that keep their export and economy usa is mafia state. Monopol on world privacy. Monopol on world security ..world trade.. taking oportunities world wide and offering opportunity only in crazy atmosphere inside USA,
This continuous disregard of the virus propagates transmission..and brings the economy to its knees.
He inherited a strong economy and it isn’t as strong now. There’s no evidence he’s done anything to really help it, and in fact, his tax cuts are likely to cause huge problems soon
You cannot even form a simple plural. It's "Zionists." And if we ran the world economy, you would not have a job. Are you unemployed and living in your parents' basement?
s2g next local tomato festival is gonna involve me throwing tomatoes at the porches of every anti-masker/"we should reopen because of The Economy" motherfucker.
obligatory reminder the "lol let's reopen for The Economy" and "um helping people with straight cash is Bad if they're not working for it " motherfuckery doesn't take into account some of us are stuck with this shit until the pandemic's over no matter what the rest of y'all do.
LOL You mean like Obama’s anemic economy?
For a country without Universal Healthcare and many more without sufficient health insurance, many Americans are super bold to be just "YOLO!" & not take this virus seriously.

What economy? Trump destroyed it. Biden will have to rebuild it from scratch, like he and President Obama did after the last GOP presidential disaster.
I am from the Netherlands and the problem is we suffer from corona crisis with our open economy and have a deficit of €68 billion euros. Instead a country with little to no corona like Hungary gets €21 billion euros. This is communism if Poland had to pay you would say no # EU
Too late to do a search but I saw a report stating 520 jobs. The removal would be staggered and chances are those employees would mostly integrate or fall off naturally. It's not a big deal. Would I accept production of nerve gas locally because it was good for the local economy?

Until now both have worked together which was convenient. As result of pandemic they may not now at least in short term. Let’s create an education plan. Let’s create a daycare plan. Let’s fund both because they are vital to the success of our economy for different reasons.
Next time someone whines about the economy, remind them that dead people can't work.
He’s absolutely right. No president in history has ever been able to destroy the economy, the environment, race relations, trade relations, employment, democracy, and hundreds of thousands of human lives in 3.5 years. GIVE YOURSELF A PAT ON THE BACK.
Big tech and the fed for sure. Technology in general is still going strong. Investors still expect the economy to turn back to what it was, which had been cranking at high levels.
Either you want to be an EU member, or you don't. If you don't, then leave. Stop calling other countries fiscally irresponsible when they've made a better job with their economy than you have.
Yep...gotta keep the housing bubble inflated or the House of Cards AKA Aus "economy" will implode with a great number of ordinary folk being left with huge debt for poorly designed homes that have been grossly overvalued for decades...it won't be pretty...
Because they are trying to kill everyone’s way of life to push their agenda. They are getting to kill the economy as well.
Which rock are you living under? Steve Schmidt is on point. Let’s do the stats:140000+ dead from the virus, 1.5 million infected, 4.8 million on unemployment, racial tensions in all states, economy is in the tank. Americans not welcome internationally. You s/b be screaming.
In the Wallace - Trump interview, Trump got exceptionally rattled when Wallace told him the Fox poll said voters thought Biden would handle the economy better. Visibly angry.
You’re not wrong. When you look at the macro this didn’t all happen at once by coincidence. BLM, Antifa, Covid, China, Economy...etc. China and the elites do not want Trump and Barr for four more years. This is all a distraction. Barr is the most underrated threat of all time

Emergency UBI would be useful, but a "national testing & contact tracing strategy" could be dangerous to our liberty and to the economy, given the high risk of false positives and calls for draconian restrictions on anyone who does test positive. Please beware of that aspect.

Everyone who really pays attention to the economy knows that if you want to live like a republican, you have to vote like a Democrat.
Which is exactly my point. New cases does not equal a public health crisis. Moving the goal posts? Is that kind of like going from 15 days to slow the spread to shut down the the economy, suspend the constitution, civil liberties, and as we know it until there is a vaccine?
Absolutely. It has nothing to do about race/ethnicity to me. Its what hes done for the country. Our taxes are lower. Paychecks are bigger. Hes protected our rights (if thats important to you). Pre-COVID the economy was booming and for Latinos specifically, record low unemployment

Nothing happened because YOU'RE LYING as usual! Obama had nothing to gain by spying on you as he was done with 8 years scandal free and a great economy... and Biden wasn't running against you back in '16. There are literally ZERO reasons they would have done it.
The people who believe in evil satanic new world order clones here are almost as ridiculous as the people who believe in an efficient centrally planned economy.
Won’t even let me reply to them, Trump is Satan and wouldn’t care at all if he kills women and kids. After all, Trump, GOP caged kids, moms, dads, at the border and some died. BP killed a Guatemalan woman in cold blood as she approached the border. COVID-19 kills, Trump’s economy

Start a war, crash the economy, go full on dictator.
No Mr President it is you who will do the exact opposite of what you promised when you ran for President in 2016. You alone will destroy America as the Pandemic returns in the fall to devastate your struggling economy & will rule out the Elections. So you'll cling on to power

Trump has had his test. He has failed miserably on: immigration, equal rights, the economy, foreign relations, the environment, appointing competent jurists to Federal Judgeships, consumer protections, assisting the working class and protecting the Constitution etc.
And worker's unions were a stopgap in the middle of this to give more rights to workers while they increased in power to eventually replace corporations and have an economy "From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs" as said by Karl Marx
Paying people more not to work does not help an economy to recover. It does the opposite. Your activism is not evidence.

What are the risks / benefits to society, individual health, public health, the economy, and our federation of having closed vs open borders over an extended period of time. The province should list them in a discussion paper.
No, what is needed is this COVID-19 fraud is ended. Dem Govs and Mayors as well as the MSM want to keep the economy shut down until the election. Dems don't care if they destroy lives if it helps them politically.
So how arse about is this loan scheme, in a pandemic the government gives banks money at the 0.5-0.25% then they loan it out at “low” rates of 7.5%. So it’s a massive handout to the banking sector but not so much for the rest of the economy.
Unimaginably bad things HAVE happened to America. Since January 20, 2017. You have taken the wind out of America's sails. Ravaged by the pandemic, the *economy* of the average American is in tatters. Only the wealthiest are making out. Your goons in Portland are YOUR anarchists.
Our president thinks Democrats are keeping economy closed to win election - this is scary to hear our leader lie & be political as he continues to divide our nation. The bigger issue is about wearing masks to keep economy open AND to save peoples lifes.

The stock market has increased much more than real GDP over the 20 years. This is due to record high profits while worker wages are stagnant/declining and companies spending less on capital investment and more on buybacks. These aren't driving factors of a strong economy.

This is stupid. Disagreeing with an opponent's plan is one thing. Pretending that their goal is to hurt America is moronic. The economy went UP in Obama administration. I got health care that allowed me to start my own business. Biden supports economic growth. His plans prove it.

Obama was a uniter not a divider... When Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson he didn't fan the flames - as Trump is doing.

This is absolutely disgraceful reporting. Shame on you Herald Sun. And shame on any selfish Australian who refuses to wear a mask for the safety of others. Not to mention the recovery of our economy which will be able to open up much sooner with this virus gone.
It’s all a hoax. The “president “ let the economy crash over a hoax. How dumb is that?
Is “during a pandemic?” the new “in this economy?”?

he couldn’t cure the common cold. Give it a rest...he’s not perfect but he did have the economy humming along until Covid came along.
No stimulus bill for people making under $40,000 they are the ones that are going to make a difference in the election ,Senator Kennedy Republican And Trump whatever he does in Washington , no unemployment $600 money no stimulus $2000 a month ,ECONOMY?

It’s all optics for trump. He’ll never do the work. He just really needs people to go back to work so he can “fix” the economy right before the election. It’s not going to work. Red states will open. Kids will die.
Unemployment rate is most definitely NOT the net change in employment levels. Job creation is not factored into the unemployment rate. You are whiffing hard.
I was talking to someone that lives overseas about Trump and they said “that man is an idiot!” I asked them why do you think that? All they could say is stuff that msm says about him. I said “during his presidency he has lowered the unemployment rate.”
i don't care about what yang said. i care about what you said. If i guessed right its largely because I looked at the data presented to me. you can use the data of the present to predict the future but you can't know it. and the current data suggest automation unemployment.
Like which ones? And who helped bring down the unemployment rate for blacks? The lowest it had been in decades. Do bigots do that? Criminal justice reform?
Next # coronavirus relief bill; you be the judge: => Trump wants to cut funding for testing, CDC, and NIH. He’ll veto bill w/o cut to payroll tax (huge benefit for large employers). **Or** => Democrats want to extend unemployment insurance benefit, fund testing and tracing.
Which is a conservative Dem platform as far from socialist as 1 can get. Btw we live in a socialist country. You enjoy many of the privileges provided by socialist programs. That stimulus check - socialist Unemployment benefits - socialist Did you advocate against either?
Psst....hey einstein- 3/4 of the nation are not working. But if they'd like to strike against their unemployment/welfare or food stamps, be my guest
Not sure I understand the logic of cutting the payroll tax to help the 20 million people on unemployment....
?????? i can see the logic for a lot of the trump admin's decisions - but why the hell are they so resistant on stopping unemployment benefits? https://twitter.com/axios/status/1284986376086327298 …
Do you think entry-level wages increasing would not lead to higher inflation in the housing market , as well as in the job market? Which would ultimately lead to a higher unemployment rate, lessening standard of living, and decrease motivation for moving up from lower level jobs.
I don’t understand how a person can finesse 10 bands and some change from unemployment and don’t get a car but get some designer? Lmao man y’all gone be fly af sitting on the couch waiting for someone to pick y’all up forever.
He doesn’t oppress minorities. That is the dumbest thing I’ve heard. He had minority unemployment at the lowest ever. I wouldnt call that oppressing. He also pushed and passed justice reform which favored minorities. Get you facts straight before opening your mouth.

Tell that to the employers who fired them. The $600 per week is an unemployment benefit for those fired or furloughed during the pandemic. It’s not a reward, but a necessity.

No. It's because they get an extra $2400 / mo plus their reg unemployment. That 2-3 times what most people on SS get each month and they don't qualify for all that fucking free money.
Holy crap, man. Why does he think that? I wish you the best, Tim and hope you can convince him to get the unemployment. It's absolutely better than nothing.
i said if one still had an income. also regular unemployment is still there just not PUA
He brought the USA GDP to the highest level it's ever been, again lowest unemployment rates IN HISTORY. Both of which u refuse to acknowledge Then comes Corona. Gee isn't it funny that Obama, Fauchi & others were at the same lab they think they virus leaked from only last yr!
so much leisure. In America men often work long hours even when they are well off; such men, naturally, are indignant at the idea of leisure for wage-earners, except as the grim punishment of unemployment; in fact, they dislike leisure even for their sons.
If the ordinary wage-earner worked four hours a day, there would be enough for everybody and no unemployment -- assuming a certain very moderate amount of sensible organization. This idea shocks the well-to-do, because they are convinced that the poor would not know how to use..

Wow. Judging people by who they vote for? Why would a racist Trump expand affordable health care options, enact criminal justice reform, sign record HBCU's funding, have lowest black unemployment rate, & create opportunity zones. What did Biden do for 8 years?

It’s 2020 - something new gon happen in just a couple days & it’s gonna be on to the next topic & I would most likely bet it’ll be directed towards the unemployment/stimulus check since Congress is scheduled to return from a 2 week vacation tomorrow.
Really and what did Obama do in his 8 years of presidency, besides allowing black on black crime to increase and not doing anything about it, and the US having higher amounts of welfare recipients, high unemployment rates and no pandemic to blame it on......
Yeah well DURING corona our unemployment is the highest its ever been. He passed an act no longer protecting lgbt people from discrim in healthcare (on the anniversary of the pulse shooting). And he has caused our country to have the most cases by valuing the economy over lives
If you’re proud NM in top 5 worst states for crime, 50th in education, one of lowest overall poverty & lowest child poverty, #1 in suicides, lowest in unemployment before COVID you just go ahead & vote Dem. 10O yrs Dem control. It doesn’t get much worse. But Hooray! Muh COVID.
Is this thread about ‘stimulus checks’ or ‘unemployment benefits.’ Your bitch is about the second...right? And this is about the first.
What are you talking about!? Unemployment hit an all-time (or significant, can’t remember the actual stat) under Trump before COVID hit! Partly because of ICE raids on corporations, but also because he brought jobs back here from overseas. Not sure how the left figures 44 did it.
You need to learn some News-Jitsu to combat fake news. Look at the charts and data, not reporter spin. Unemployment started with covid. And everything I said about what Trump did is true. Go look those things up.
It doesn’t affect me. I’m not on unemployment and also did not qualify for a stimulus check.

He literally said he doesn’t want 4 more years of the lowest unemployment since the great depression. He wants high unemployment, probably to get some welfare. what an idiot.
And the extra $600/week runs out this month. Most states only give 50% for unemployment benefits (if that). No one can live on that. I think that we are in for a rude awakening as a society when a huge chunk of society won’t be able to pay their bills.
Never understood why y’all be So mad niggas getting unemployment
I’ve been furloughed for 4 months and still haven’t gotten my unemployment. Literally a week before I was supposed to go back to work everything started shutting down again. I’m desperate for a second stimulus at the very least

That’s because MSM spends its ink trying to show him as a racist. Trump has repealed Democrat laws that targeted minorities and has lowered the unemployment rate putting more people, including minorities back to work. It’s the Democrat run states that have the high death rates
Black unemployment was at its lowest levels ever recorded before the China Virus. Fact.
Facts: Depending on your job & your state benefits, yes, many p/t worker are making more with the extra $600 wkly on top of unemployment benefits. I’m not saying don’t help, I believe the funds should equal what employees are missing from their normal wages. Not blanket funding.

Worse how? Our unemployment rate for everyone is the lowest it’s ever been, our countries more eco friendly than it’s been in 50 years.
Over 142,000 dead American citizens 11.1% unemployment rate Russia paying bounties for killing American troops ON TRUMP'S WATCH # failure # UnfitForOffice
Given trumps record unemployment numbers you know this isn’t true. Obama and Biden created more jobs than any other president including and especially trump.
one needn't look too hard to see this is not true. companies took tax break and bought down debt. no major hirings were made. on his watch (with covid) unemployment hit record rates.

tanked economy/ 145 thousand dead americans in 5 months. No wall to speak of. Mexico did not pay for it. Dismisses our checks and balances/ dismisses our congress. Is a lawless criminal slob. Lies. unemployment is 11.6% / 1 million again filed for unemployment that totals 17 week
Wouldn’t be farfetched to assume that this increase in support from the afro-american community is caused by Trumps constant rambling of low unemployment and/or the 1994 crime bill.
Black unemployment was at the lowest it has ever been. He did criminal justice reform he signed a executive order for equality under the law
Unless we all help, the next crisis will be the lack of education for our people, future unemployment and greater inequality. Enrollment is down and in many places, they do not have the capability to provide their schools or their students with devices to go online.

Black unemployment being low doesn't really matter when wages don't match cost of living, and the wealth gap is growing wider than ever before. Prison reform doesn't really matter when nothing is done about for-profit and privatized prisons.
There will likely be millions of people still out of work when the $600 a week "boost" to unemployment benefits ends on July 31. Here are some ways to adjust your budget when unemployment benefit payments stop: https://bit.ly/3eiNfuq # Unemployment # FinancialPlanning # Financepic.twitter.com/7TZZJkkDXq

@ realDonaldTrump Part of next bill needs to be: More money for PPP !!! Keep unemployment rate LOW!
Academic freeze = unemployment of around 50k teachers and employees in related industries. (counterpart effect)
that’s what i meant tbh the unemployment checks. i really hope they extend it because if they don’t, people will have to go back to work and especially when cases are spiking like this all over the country we might be finito. ppl won’t be able to pay rent/mortgages
Donald Trump has the lowest black unemployment rate. You got to make your money, let us poor people make ours. Or are you mad other black folks are starting to make some money too? Who is the real racist here?
However, @ GovSisolak is holding off a 2nd special session to deal w/ # unemployment & # justicereform because of COVID numbers. When/if he calls a 2nd session, justice reform could restore some health services cuts - like homelessness and mental health. # nvleg @ cceanv @ CcsdParents

Not really, we could’ve scrapped and redone the budget but we can do that with more clarity in Nov. On unemployment we could’ve demanded a new vendor but that would take months to procure and months to build/implement and Floridians would be hurt in their most desperate months.

COVID has and is most definitely going to cause more and more people to suffer with mental illnesses. It is traumatic to live through a pandemic, not to mention the other things relating to Covid like unemployment and grief.
me neither. unemployment stalled me..no stimulus. I'm putting in for the pua since I'm an independent contractor and hoping thatll work.
Call me crazy (you have) but I think 140,000 dead from an out-of-control virus, an ineffective, understaffed government, double-digit unemployment, a diminished global reputation and no plan to fix anything suggests the current POTUS is a dud.
Seeing how tone deaf they are is kinda fun. Like Kim posting about her 14 Friesian horses in the middle of a pandemic and record unemployment...
And for those who choose not to read, the largest drop in taxes paid was for working people making between $25k-$100k, just like President Trump told us it would be. The tax cuts also saved countless businesses, and helped reduce unemployment to all-time historical lows.
I missed this, I think that there is a real discussion to be had there, because some people say unemployment exists because of minimum wages that prices people out of the low-skill job market, but I don’t actually agree with that, but I don’t know the answer either.
unemployment been playing with me for 3 months i just said forget it. what if it’s people out here waiting longer with no hope or help? smh
It’s not even that - you cut unemployment benefits and a lot of people become very poor very fast. Not a great way to keep voters happy or keep the economy afloat months from an election. They’re industrial-grade morons.
Trump brags quite often about how he is "lowering unemployment for group X, Y, and Z". And he shows non-whites in his campaign videos in a positive light.

The more I think about this, the angrier I get. There are ~30 million workers who depend on enhanced unemployment benefits that expire next week. Many are worried about making August rent. This type of brinksmanship would've been cute in May, but we're way past that point now. https://twitter.com/Brendan_Duke/status/1284972203625328641 …
I’m so glad I AINT do unemployment cause y’all got 13 more days to front with y’all money time to chase a real bag
The # CARESCliff is Jul 31 (some will feel it earlier due to phasing). The # HEROESAct seeks to meet need by putting ppl first. Here's some of what it funds: - federal subsidy for # unemployment - # stimuluschecks - # rentrelief - # testtraceisolate - # education - # state & # local govs
Systemic Racism is Joe Biden's Crime Bill which targeted Blacks/Hispanics, stole their freedom, locked them up and threw away the key! Thank President Trump, Prison Reform, First Step Act, Opportunity Zones, Historic Lowest Black/Hispanic Unemployment, Millions for HBCU! # KAG
So my daughter says, “mom are you gonna get dressed today?” Well, let’s see, it’s almost 6:30 pm. I’m not exactly seeing the point! Should not take all day to file unemployment. Maybe there’s a reason I got fired! Just saying.... pic.twitter.com/9WTEzm9OTm
Paying taxes to fund endless wars doesn't help wealth trickle down. What creates wealth is jobs, and Trump ushered the lowest unemployment rate among Blacks and Hispanics in US history.
Wait. You’re saying we have record unemployment? During our current pandemic-driven economic crisis? You been chugging bleach, Wolly?
How has he supported Goya more than Americans if black unemployment is at an all time low? From the outside looking in you sound like a lunatic
Climate plan or not, I second some kind of large infrastructure bill long overdue for the US, and especially timely for domestic massive unemployment.
why in the hell would anyone tell you that? unless you’ve already received the unemployment card it’s gonna take WEEEKS to come... direct deposit is always the quickest/efficient way.
You are destroying our country. Just look at all the infections, all the Russian Corruption, all the racial violence, all the smoke and tear gas. This is Trumps America. # Unemployment # COVID19 # # Unhinged Are you better off today than you were four years ago? # Biden2020

$devin9210 please lost my job and havent gotten any money out unemployment in a month for family of 3
Why did my aunty ask me if my stripper friends had fans only..... & does that count as unemployment ..... yea this is why I can’t bring just anybody around
What jobs? Don’t you have more unemployment than the Great Depression?
@ pulte could use help too wife's laid off as waitress and the extra unemployment is ending
So are they not gonna take our tax money this year...? Whether this year was unemployment, essential work, or anything in between. I don’t think we should have to pay 2020 taxes.
In the past the Gov. created critical infrastructure jobs to help in high unemployment situations. They limited work hours during the Depression, and created overtime pay to incentivize hiring more people rather than paying fewer more.
WHY SHOULD ANYONE GET PAID FOR NOT WORKING? AN INJURY IS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT MATTER. WHEN EVERYONE ELSE GETS LAID OFF THEY FILE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT. GUARANTEED WORK MONEY APPLIES TO YOUR JOB STILL BEING ACTIVE, THEREFORE IF GAMES OR THE SEASON IS CANCELLED,NO WORK NO BIG PAYDAY
How’s unemployment? pic.twitter.com/n3j0IyUbmK
If Congress doesn't renew the extra 600/month unemployment benefits, things will spiral. Many people depend on that money. I'm "lucky" that I foresaw financial issues & moved to my mom's;I still pay rent but it's way less.I'm scared 4 friends that won't be able to afford to live.
Your numbers are false, and I thought we were talking about black unemployment.
The fact that our congress, our so called leaders, that supposedly work for the people of this country, would go into a recess when there’s a global pandemic combined with rocketing homelessness + unemployment...
ISIS is still in existence. Illegals have slowed due to COVID-19, Unemployment is higher now than any time since the Great Depression and the Stock Market isn’t the Economy, businesses and housing is and both are in a downward trend. Everything you said is # LiesLiesLies

The far left want to eliminate healthcare and security nets like unemployment and social security? Man what? And I'll agree that there are folks who are racist and bigoted - but they're also not looking to make queer folk subhuman, or revoke the rights of black folks, etc.

The country’s in ruin. The economy is doing poorly. Unemployment is high. There is massive discord among the citizens. There is one person sitting at the center of it. If you vote for him, you’re as bad as he is. That’s your defense.
Collecting this unemployment ain't bad at all
Lol show the proof of racism....because he is failing at that compared to the unemployment of race votes.
“we don’t want people to have $600 p/w unemployment because it disincentivizes people to get back to work” then raise the minimum wage? people on unemployment should make the same as people who are working minimum wage why is that such a hard concept to grasp https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/1284858118577557506 …
Lowest unemployment in history, for EVERY SINGLE GROUP, booming economy, you have 1500 TV channels and broadband internet access, everyone has a smart phone, we want for nothing, we vote for our leaders. We have never had it better. But yes, just like living under a monarchy.
This is the last week of $600 unemployment benefits https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/19/politics/unemployment-benefits-economy-congress/index.html …

Hillary, to many, meant more of the same left behind feeling. That’s how we got Trump. And Russia helped. The astonishing thing is that after Trump won, the Federal Reserve did more MASSIVE QE further inflating the stock market bubble. And Trump loved it! Fucking hypocrite!
So there we were in 2016 with a stock market looking good and the unemployment rate dropping. But real ppl feel left out. Why does everything look so good and I’m driving for Uber? This is bullshit! Candidate Trump called it bullshit. He was right.
To help us out of the mess, the Federal Reserve bought up all the mortgage backed securities because no one wanted them. They also started buying bonds and stock. They called it quantitative easing. It made the stock market go up. Trump correctly called it a bubble back then...

The stock market is NOT the economy. Trump benefited from Obama's economic stewardship. Trump's economic strategy during his first 3 years (201–2019) was to boost economic growth via tax cuts and additional spending, both of which significantly increased federal budget deficits.
Before Wall Street became the world's largest stock exchange, the location thrived as a slave market between 1711 and 1762, according to JSTOR Daily. In 2015 Mayor Bill de Blasio commemorated a marker to the enslaved people who laid the foundation for Wall Street.

There will always be dipshits who can’t tell the difference between natural technological innovation and the government forcibly shutting a business down
And don't forget, the FSA was a move to stop clemency for enslaved persons residing in free territories. So, shutting down avenues to get enslaved people free, can't own a business, and risking life and limb to figure out a moderately better life is being excised here. Bad imo.
It didn’t improve, went into recession before Covid hit? The economy continued to improve and business shutting down caused the recession we experienced.
Mitts whole business career was shutting down union factories and moving the jobs overseas. Then as governor of Mass did nothing
NYC more interested in shutting down business then stoping the mass murder of black men in the streets of the city.
Exactly why minding your business and shutting the fuck up is always the best option
So forcibly shutting down Private Business & determining non-essential vs essential was ok though?
Meanwhile other businesses are shutting down for good because of your lack of any common sense to a small business owner. FU
Mentally ill is justifying lighting a local police union office on fire because you're upset at the feds. I don't expect you to understand how a family losing their livelihood due to goverment shutting down their business being more tragic than going to holding for questioning
Wearing a stupid mask does almost nothing. It is windo dressing. You are also shutting down and killing small business in NM. Many will not reopen. I hope that all remember who screwed these people, at your next election, if you are not recalled before. # WalkAwayFromDemocrats

Sir, why is IIFL shutting its lending business and cutting jobs in heaps?
This may happen in lot of countries as economy has been destroyed or is spiraling downwards and growing unemployment shutting down business will bring people on streets against their governments.
But the reason for shutting down the business is “Lack of social distancing?”
The biggest complaint about shutting things down is that it disproportionately affects small business owners. That's super valid. So why did we give $1.5 t r i l l i o n to wall street?
Each State has their own militia in their National Guard. They have been trained. They should be shutting down militias & sending them back to Barr with a big note on the chests-stay out of out state business or risk the consequences.
something about men not shutting the fuck up and minding their business just don’t sit right with me
Funny they said shutting down business forb3 months would stop it too. Can't live scared of a virus with a .03% mortality rate.

In my opinion, even if shutting down is not specifically called for, certain business not just in Georgia but nationwide MUST shut down again to # StopTheSpread and # FlattenTheCurve especially since far too many refuse to wear masks. # TakeThisSeriously # StayAtHome
Control left governors. Refuse to open schools, shutting down business and gatherings to ruin the economy.

Okay okay lol ... I swear if they fuck it up again he shutting us down the same business day lmao
People are losing their jobs. Business owners are shutting down. Roads are going to hell. Taxes are going to go up more than ever before and it created an attitude of why should I get a job I can keep collecting these checks. It’s unreal
As I’ve said since February, when I had to cancel my business trip to Asia, everyone is going to get it. Stop delaying the inevitable. There won’t be a vaccine worth a damn ever. The consequences of shutting the world down will cause collateral damage far greater than Covid-19.
I guess the real question constituents have is, why won’t you support the Small Business Jobs Survival Act instead of pretending to implement legislation that has no real chance of saving businesses from shutting down, @ KeithPowersNYC? Capping GrubHub isn’t going to save us.

Jay.... the death rate in Sweden for people under 70... without shutting down business... .0002%. 10.3 million population... child deaths zero... Of course, the media ignores that detail. This isn’t about science.

Only people worried are liberal progressives & media hoping they can panic states into shutting down & killing the economy for the election. The big business, gov workers & welfare people are fine staying home. It’s the small business class they want to kill with CV panic.
The mayor is not shutting down any business, she issued a mandatory mask order, just like other mayors in the state have done. But Kemp never sued them, not even the mayor in his home town. And btw, many stores are doing a mask policy, Walmart, Kroger, etc. So Kemp is stupid.

No they were in a regular cleaning schedule. They weren’t sanitizing. It was business as usual. You’re being misleading by passing off regular cleaning and business as usual as actually shutting down and cleaning.

GDP goes up when we monetize the informal economy. If people stop doing things for each other, making things for themselves and others, and start buying all good and services GDP goes up, that doesn't mean their lives have gotten better
Because they’re 2 completely different things lol? And the US doubles the 2nd highest GDP which is China if I’m not wrong. And Worker wages are fine. You’re not supposed to work a min wage job your whole life. Raising the min wage would lower the incentive to hire young workers.-
"You talked about 3%" No I didn't. I talked about reducing debt, not because of the 3% rule but because of the 60% GDP rule. The 3% rule would only force you to stay below 3% budget deficit. The 60% GDP rule should force any country above that mark to reduce their debt.

The stock market has increased much more than real GDP over the 20 years. This is due to record high profits while worker wages are stagnant/declining and companies spending less on capital investment and more on buybacks. These aren't driving factors of a strong economy.

quite right. Official total and per capita GDP in the UK are higher than Italy's but nowhere near twice or even 1.5 times as high. Moreover, Italy's official figure are distorted by its black economy although a fair bit of the City's business also escapes the taxman.
Oh, they're working to keep the stock market positive and GDP growing. They couldn't give a shit less about citizens.

Show me tangible proof Eddy. If you take any GDP number and add on a remainer % statistic then the greater our GDP increases, the greater the “loss”. Surely even you can see what daft reasoning that is?
When compared to BRICS economies and other emerging market peers, India stands out favourably. Brazil has a savings rate of 16 per cent of GDP, Mexico 23 per cent, and the Philippines 14.2 per cent. But bigger rival China is at 46 per cent, data with the World Bank shows.

Let's see Obama turned a Republican disaster of an economy around; negative 6.9% GPD to positive GDP for 6 years. Unemployment from 10% down to 4.1. Trump has negative GDP, 18% unemployment. Keep America Great? More like destroy the country with your lousy leadership.
Rise of Asia in General. India will be bigger than America in term of total GDP. people need to rethink.
I'm not sure, but I think that $500k per year puts one pretty solidly in the 1%. That evil, privileged group that the left is always whining about. $500k per person in the US is $150 trillion. GDP is about $20 trillion. There isn't enough money to pay people this much.
It would be interesting if more recent data was different, definitely. Effective tax % is the most apples-to-apples comparison I'm aware of between the diversity of tax regime structures. Another 5-10% of GDP would fund quite a lot
Rowling's sales are huge, so short-term fluctuations in sales (up or down), expressed as a percentage of total sales, will almost always be smaller than for a new or less popular books. It's the same reason US GDP doesn't fluctuate percentage-wise as much as North Korea's.
Keep up the good work. You're on the right path. Scotland is a mess thanks to Nicola Sturgeon's poor leadership. 900+ extra cancer deaths since the Lockdown, eventually they will overtake flu deaths. GDP down NINETY per cent. It's a mess.
The issue is that fiscal deficits aren't an issue until they are. The US deficit for this year is already larger than the entire GDP of France.

Best way to support local businesses and Trump is to wear a mask. At this point, it’s all perception. Consumer confidence is down. Those over 50 represents 50% of GDP. Keep telling them to stay home and Biden wins. This economy needs everyone to participate and not lay blame.
we are spending less as a proportion of GDP relative to similar countries, all while the complexity of healthcare is growing and the population is aging
As I said before, this is not a simple question. E.g. if when calculating gdp for Mexico and the US for the 1830s one puts California as part of US gdp instead of Mexico’s, the result is an anachronistic choice that has ideological and present-day political implications.
Cuba has been under US Embargo for decades and still manages to have a higher per capita GDP than most other Caribbean islands. I prefer regulated capitalism and social democracy to Communism, but CUBA is evidence that communism generates good outcomes economically

'"Around 20 years ago China was at the same GDP as India's... India has the potential for similar growth,” Panjwani said.' I'm not sure I agree.

In the electoral scene of Japan, Tokyo occupies a special position as it forms the epicentre of all political and economic activities.

There is no lack of investment in Italy. That is not the problem. There is an abundance of bureaucracy, the highest corporate taxes in Europe, the biggest black market and too much government debt for their GDP. Investing in Bulgaria, does not solve that for sure.
Curious regarding what defines "the greatest economy"? Is it unemployment figures, wealth creation, GDP, sustainability or....? Feel free to comment
Smallest GDP growth since records were taken. Ok.

BTW, as I recall your family emigrated from Sri Lanka. A more immediate actual problem is that Sri Lanka, due to its GDP/ failures to service China EXIM bank loans has granted a NEW 99-year lease and 70 per cent stake in Hambantota Port to China. Big problem
Right, we spend 3600% of our GDP on defense.
GOP s reams comeback lol, 52 million Americans out of work, 150,000 dead, disease across America, negative —5% GDP, 11.2% unemployment, 15% minority unemployment, comeback , what a joke!!!
And the fact that in return for this "oh so perfect policy", Sweden does not gain anything with regards to GDP? Does that mean nothing to you?
Reopen everything, and another hundred thousand people will die, so the GDP will not rebound. Blaming Cuomo for these people dying is like blaming JFK's death on his limo driver.
Freed from the horrors of white oppression, the Liberians created a real-life Wakanda, only with life expectancy still in the low 60s. And a recent civil war. And GDP per capita of $700pa. And ebola, polygamy, pygmy hippo bushmeat for tea, and a footballer for a president. Nice.

Countries of high GDP selected in simplified personalization, would be quite pathetic if only one person leads a country. Not even a football team is lead by one only. And some of those less population density. Which means they could put in place measures others could not
It already has the biggest economy in terms of GDP ppp
People in the north didn’t see it “immoral” they saw it as unprofitable because their GDP was in textiles not crops. They wanted to prevent their hugely profitable southern states from seceding and fought to keep them part of the Union. The northerners were not generally heroes.
So now u will go to this lame excuse. Next thing u will b saying every1 buys food. Here we talk revenues and GDP
Agree; it's BS. Support for IT-ES-PORT-GRE ? YES, if the north borrows, it has to be paid back by the south. The "subsidies" (idiotic word) only with strict guarantees, like Rutte demands. NO free money. Why? the lousy GDP of these 4 vs the north nxt to 132% debt vs GDP by IT >>

You are still parroting the same talking points from the US State Dept. US capitalists offered mortgages to create bubbles. They bought up all the prosperities for pennies when the bubbles burst. China is building infrastructures for them that increase GDP. How r they the same?
What have you done to actually make America great again? Nothing but lie and embolden racist! 1. You haven't kept a single promise. 2. Obama grew the economy better and faster. 3. Your tariffs cost farms over 300k jobs. 4. GDP is down by .04 since your trade war started.
We have 4% of the world's population, but year after year we enjoy 25% of global GDP. We have never been anyone's doormat. Trump has been lying to you this whole time.
"working from home is not detremental to productivity". That's why in April 2020 the UK's GDP fell by an unprecedented -20.4%. Here we have an ex-GSK employee lecturing the UK about economics. No wonder the UK is fucked. https://youtu.be/xTwxgoapYZ0
I'm thinking it will just be different winners if/when Biden wins. May even have better marginal returns so far as GDP growth goes, but that's just speculation.
Italy has the second pension spending among developed countries (the double of the average). We have one of the highest government spending (48% of GDP). About 70% of GDP is managed by government (we have a socialist economy). We don’t need money, we need reforms. It’s our fault.
Day dreaming must be meaningful!! Do ever thought about hiw GDP works or still in brainwashed mode? Your country in sucidal mode, save it if you can!!
Obama Biden inherited a recession from Bush, lower unemployment down to 4.5 and grew GDP. They handed the Orange turd an excellent economy. Trump tweeted, played golf, and shit out cheeseburgers for 3 years, and fucked it all up, liar

No doubt, In fact we had the GDP capacity to enable healthcare for all, end poverty for all, feed all, and provide free education for all since the 80s. What we dont have is a distribution system infallible to racist, ableist, bigoted, and imperialist influences. That's the issue
7/8 The Foreign Minister also highlighted that despite its financial difficulties, Pakistan had deployed $ 8 billion, 3 percent of its GDP, to assist our disadvantaged and poor. @ ForeignOfficePK
5/9 Over 7 billion people, were struggling to mobilize even $1 trillion - around 1% of GDP - to respond to the health and economic challenges. To overcome @ ImranKhanPTI proposed debt relief as one of the quickest ways to provide essential fiscal space to developing countries.
4/9 The Foreign Minister pointed out that while the rich nations, with a population of 1.5 billion, had generated nearly $10 trillion in deficit financing to address the crisis, amounting to 10-20 percent of their GDP, developing countries, poorest would suffer the most.

Most durable and successful cultural values evolved to provide some kind of fulfilling, satisfactory life. Market culture/values didn’t evolve organically, but are centrally planned by marketers to increase GDP. If you want your kids to be happy, don’t let the market raise them.

The first one says GVA, in the smaller text. The second one says GDP.
The jobs lost were those in Coal. And yes they are not coming back. Obama created 15 million new jobs. The unemployment rate was 4.7 when he left office. Trump has lost 51 million jobs in 4 months. And the GDP is now negative.
@ NAACP Portland is Trump testing how to militarily take over the USA. If you don't believe it we can talk after he suspends the elections. In the meantime- Polling on Economy? - Obama - 3.2% GDP his last 3 years - Trump down to 2.9% his 3 years. T-rex did nothing for the economy.
Economy is fine. Reopen everything and GDP will rebound In one quarter. People dying from a virus isn’t anyone’s fault, except maybe Cuomo. Deficit was a problem long before Trump. Even if you hate Trump, Biden is still a horrible choice.
hi this is insane and maybe don't feel bad for them, fight them.
Yes, but they do not have the highest homeless rate in the country, a relatively high GDP per capita, and you can't talk about dept and support Trump. pic.twitter.com/rNo3XvzZHv
The government’s own analysis showed the base case outcome for a trade deal with the US would be a 0.16% increase in GDP over 5 years. The opposition can do maths, that’s why !
What do you mean their GDP comes from terrorist activities explain the logic there
Because it's now obvious, even the UN set out plans for countries, that one above is Germany's personal plan, one for mine as-well, we are just numbers to people on the top, replacing us for the GDP isn't an issue for them, they live in nice secluded places while we deal with it.

One forgets easily that the EU budget is only 1% of GDP this is peanuts compared to national budgets
There is no such thing as EU GDP, there are only countries in Europe.
EU GDP is more than 15.000 billion euro. So 50 billion is a “little gap” actually.

The greatest economy ever. His best annual GDP growth was 2.9% . Obama's best year was 2.9% . Bush and Clinton had multiple years that beat 2.9% gdp. So what metric is Trump using unemployment. Yes the numbers are low but the jobs created are in low wage job sectors.
It is on GDP.
