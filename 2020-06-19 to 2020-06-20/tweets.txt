To which place are more people trying to immigrate? Which place won't let you leave? Which place drives the world economy? Which place leads tech innovation?
anyway, my point is that we shouldn’t regard this mass push to reopen the economy as pure stupidity. It *is* stupid, but it’s more than; it’s a lack of concern, a lack of empathy, a lack of accountability, an inability to deal with a major change in lifestyle
I’m talking down to the local levels where entire county boards and mayors offices are Democrat areas that drag their feet to reopen even if the science supports them going to the next level of reopening The underlying reason it’s just slow the economy in an effort to hurt Trump

Yeah they are really dropping like flies. Way better to shut down the economy and kill millions of people’s lives. You should know you can’t make it disappear. This is all political.
Of course you would show a graph only from April until now. This was the result of the Corona virus. President Trump had nothing to do with the economy failing during the pandemic. The governor's and other elected officials caused the recession!
They called it a hoax in the beginning. Then they said we needed to re open the country for the economy. More Americans are going to die and it's so fucking heartbreaking. https://twitter.com/ASlavitt/status/1273973204047069184 …

Our economy is pretty much the same as yours, Groucho. We have lost the vast majority of our manufacturing industries to China, just as you have. The CCP is trying to control the manufacturing of the entire world, not just America.
Imagine how many lives could be saved if we did a human experiment and every American wore a mask in public for just 4 weeks! Might even save the economy .
Yeah sorry but reopening the economy is an accomplishment slicker drips
There is no even a single new town build under the ANC rule since 1994, there is no new industrial innovation u could think of over the past 28 years. So white South Africans must return to political power again to create inclusive economy for the ANC.
Shutting people up in their homes and tanking the economy also comes with very high costs not just in dollars, but in human lives.

No, but the @ TheDemocrats are trying to pretend it is & are also trying to encourage more protesting so that @ POTUS cannot get the economy back up and running, so basically the Dems want to kill business and American people, purely to stop TRUMP & gain power again - BBC ARE DEMS
Yesss I fully agree and I would love for my income to be redistributed through taxes rather than consumption. And to then change the inner workings of our economy system so as to arrive at different outcomes in the first place.
The government has decided we are worth sacrificing to save the economy.
In a capitalist system, yes. A market socialist system is different. At some level, there will always be competition. Whether the decisions are decentralized in a market, or centralized in a planned economy, there is still competition between ideas.
the TRUTH is that the Democrats & their MSM publicist like @ ABC have POLITICIZED the # CoronaVirus: the dems FIRST said stopping flights from china was # Racist & # Covid19 was # JustTheFLU ... then they figured out they could TRY TO BLAME TRUMP for it & hold the economy HOSTAGE ...

“We?” You mean President Obama created a base of strong economy. You threw us back into recession, and are trying to take credit for the expected post-COVID uptick. I will not miss your lies or the sound of your whiny voice when you are voted out.
All lives didn't matter when you were calling for the economy to be opened a while ago.
If we keep importing 350k every year, there will be. Consumer and service economy while the only thing proudly made in Canada will be weed
Yes you have done far more Destroying of the Constitution Murdering Innocent Americans Encouraging racist fascist xenophobic demagogues to crawl out from under their rocks Ruin the Economy Destroy Environmental protections
Your first 2 reasons fall in the same category bud. You have nothing to say besides “good economy” bc he hasnt done anything else. 1 achievement is nothing to brag about. And fyi Obama ended his 2 terms with a lower national debt whereas trump in 3 years already increased it.
Arguably, class is playing a much bigger role in the UK and France than in the US. On the other hand, the discussion of class is more taboo in the US, and the social justice discourse is much more interested in race and gender than in economy, networks and culture.
Record setting. The economy opened. It was expected after record setting unemployment. Stop with this nonsense. It won't get you votes
Do people really think that more businesses are opening up because it’s “safe”??? It’s for the economy ding dongs. Stay y’all asses HOME if you don’t work.
Mitch helped you destroy the economy? Did he also help you incite race riots? Was he your little helper when you did absolutely nothing for two months as a pandemic swept over our country?
Feet per gallon...at what point do you start stating the fuel economy at gallons per mile?
I know it sounds a bit conspiracy theory, but if you wanted to crash the economy and bring about one world bank and one currency, the fed is going about it the right way, now planning to buy up all debt, no matter how bad it is. All of the west seems to want massive recession.
All trump knows what to do is fire people , lead a country he failed .. the economy is going to get back NOT cause of him but because of the people , trump lure in all the racist and selfish people all the hate in America be better Donald u let 118k of America’s die
What they don’t realize is they’re about to get both: a crushed economy and death.

I have a horrible feeling that the economy is going to get a lot worse when people realize you can't buy your way out of a pandemic. No amount of shopping or haircuts is going to protect the economy from a large portion of the workforce being unable to work ever again
There's enough science that says if we actually wear a mask and actually social distance the pandemic will be slowed and contained sufficiently to allow us to keep the economy open. Too bad half the people refuse to do that.
Oh cool, what’re you gonna do for work? And a beach trip? In this economy??

Thats ur only response? Maybe my second reply was enough. I could keep going on. But no matter what I show you, you’ll still hate trump because they liberal media told you how to feel about him. Learn to think for yourself. Strongest economy EVER before the outbreak. Remember tht
The economy has natural trends of growth and recessions. Bush set us up for the 2008 crash, that was then inherited by Obama. At the end of Obama's presidency the economy was trending upwards. Trump inherited an upward trending economy.
You act like nobody else is going to die. Like it’s over. Have you not seen today’s #’s???? Lies!! The economy hasn’t been open long enough to even get retail numbers fool! Hey AMERICA, DT thinks we’re stupid.

Doing the same myself. Until there's a vaccination or better treatment, I don't see the economy recovering all that much.
I mean, it would though? Just in the indirect way of containing the virus and thus helping the economy, rather than a point-scoring identity politics way
I'm going to need you to remove your lips from Trump's ass. Did you see the covid-19 numbers today? This isn't going away. While the economy is important, human life is more so. That's just my humble opinion. Also great work on sitting us back on women's rights.

To be honest, the global economy has largely taken on new debt to pay off old debt (and invest in growth) for a long time. So in the sense of new money providing returns to old money, there are some ponzi-like elements to our credit binge.

You can stop making the pandemic a party issue because it isn't. Florida's governor reopened the state before the government even advised him to do so and our numbers have skyrocketed. Shutting down and being patient is less harmful to our economy than shutting down twice.

Trump is a GD idiot. With an economy as good, an a left as crazy as they are... If he really was Reagan this would be another 49 state victory. But he's a petty idiot who can't see what's right in front of him, and he might actually lose. The left is giving him so many gifts
EXPLAIN Trump was handed an economy In 2017, his first year in office the deficit grew to $666 billion, was $984 billion last year is projected to be over $1 trillion in 2020 at $1.02 trillion. This would be a 74% increase in four years going the deficit could to $1.7 2030.
Boris Johnson has destroyed our economy and ruined our society He will go down in history as the worst PM ever Unemployment is the highest since records began Law and Order is a joke with the police being told to kneel in front of rioters and thugs
"The ultimate resource in economic development is people. It is people, not capital or raw materials that develop an economy."
So well put. # Trump is out of touch with the state of matters. The issues of most note are income inequality and why participate in an economy where the very few gain so so much. This is the basis for a civil war
So happy to hear that we, the American people, are risking our lives so dear leader can feel better about himself. At least his base. Still not sure of his long term plan. Numbers will increase, ppl will die, economy will continue to dip. His poll numbers will still plummet.
Lol you think everyone is as dim witted as you? America isn’t a capitalist country, it’s a mixed economy with tons of public-private coordination that benefits wealthy people, regardless of race. Look at the role your BIPOC saudis play in US policy making.
LIE AFTER LIE. TRUMP IS A ASSHOLE IN EVERY FORM OF THE WORD. HE ONLY CLOSED THINGS DOWN AFTER HE GOLFED 6 TIMES AND HELD 5 RALLIES IN JAN. THE ECONOMY COMING BACK WOULD DO SO NO MATTER WHOIS PRESIDENT. HES TAKING CREDIT FOR DOING NOTHING! NO LEADERSHIP HERE !!!!!!!!!!
When you go from ‘economy closed’ to ‘economy open’.....I’m thinking you better see improvement.
At this point I feel the only way to stay safe is to stay home and limit contact with people because of the GOP. I’m sure I’m not alone. Let’s see what happens to the economy when half of the populace decides to stay home.

Reality: The deaths in all States are statistically insignificant. 90% of them are due to other mortalities. They did this to shut Americans up, destroy the economy, and punish them for electing a populist President, instead of HRC. That, and the long-term surveillance grid.
Trump has trashed the economy, made the highest unemployment since the Great Depression, caused the deaths of 120,000 Americans from a pandemic and all while hiding in a bunker! Quite an accomplishment and FAR more than any other President.

Dude that’s so BS. There was a recession due to a global pandemic. In fact, Democrat states recorded the worst job loss and economic recessions. Until the pandemic, Trump had the economy on record breaking levels. Unemployment was at a record low too. Go away u bot.

He has reduced burdensome regulations, gotten the US better trade deals and given us a great pre-covid economy.
The conman over sells what he actually delivers, under sells what he was given. He was given an economy on cruise control, an economy with the longest post war expansion. His only accomplishment was a massive permanent tax break for the 1% and huge deficits. FU! NUT JOB!
Other countries reintroducing lockdown while getting a couple of hundred cases a day. We're getting over a thousand a day, have no workable track & trace system, and are (purely for the economy's sake) lowering the risk level and coming out of lockdown. Madness.
But many were compelled to go with the left's COVID tyranny by panicked pundits, playing into the left's hand to destroy economy and set the stage for riots and chaos. Good econ would limit the violence. cc: @ C4CEOhttps://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/1274113836853886976 …

They weren’t the last time they crashed the economy. Mnuchin should be arrested for illegal foreclosures , but look where he is. If we get out of this and I’m not positive we will, they will certainly be charged and sent to jail. Over 40 people went to prison over Watergate ,
In reply to last comment prior to you blocking. Other causes of death are very much on the decrease which any shallow research effort would show you. 160K is not a lot in the big picture. Not worth shutting down the economy and looking like freaks with masks walking around
Virus’s & disease’s break out all over the world & spread. We live in a global economy. China warned the world on Jan. 24, the WHO on Jan. 30 the rest is on each country as to what they choose to do. Trump choose to do virtually nothing & what he did do 6 weeks to late.

I guess if the idea of jews being part of the slave economy and accepted member of pre war society had legs it would be verified by the number of jews in the confederate govt. That would be interesting. I would be surprised if they did.
It would be fine but really it would be far more valuable to have a regular income than a one off payment. $1 million is only about nine years of UBI. The benefits to the economy are far greater with a regular payment as well, because people will only spend if they feel secure.
Isn’t this a good news during pandemic? Economy is collapsing, unemployment is on record high. Those farm goods have shelf life and farmers hard work! Don’t they deserve a livelihood?
This is the ultimate in insensitivity. To suggest that tens of thousands of people lost their lives for the sake of a better economy. If you don't want to lose to Biden, you should just resign NOW, TODAY, before you kill more with your useless rally. All for your entertainment.

If COVID created unrivaled job growth among minority communities and gave us the best economy in 50 years, then yeah - it would be a good thing to mention that.

Oh you mean like delivering the lowest black unemployment ever.
Those were photo ops.,a lot of companies left America..Trump didn’t make more Employement last week no they discussed that all the money sent to employers to save those workers were paid like unemployment insurance to stay..he took those numbers,,
He is lying. The job numbers were 3% off. There is a minimum of 16% unemployment the worst since the great depression.

May jobs numbers were incorrect & you knew about the error. You LIED about them. Lost job numbers were the highest ever. Do you know unemployment is over 16%? You have failed America. You have disappointed, let down, destroyed and failed all of us.
44% of ppl who applied for unemployment have been denied or are still waiting. Depending upon the State, ppl have had to have been on their job for at least 20 weeks, or in others, up to at least a yr. 1 stimulus ck, that many didn't even get, IN AMERICA, is unacceptable.
MANY claimants have kids they have to watch because of COVID, or job interviews because they haven’t gotten unemployment in three months, or God forbid they want to go to the grocery store.

Dude that’s so BS. There was a recession due to a global pandemic. In fact, Democrat states recorded the worst job loss and economic recessions. Until the pandemic, Trump had the economy on record breaking levels. Unemployment was at a record low too. Go away u bot.
U & Obama had 8 years to reform policing & improve the plight of Blacks in inner cities under decades of Democrat rule. They still face poverty, crime, unemployment (largely by your support 4 open borders resulting in endless numbers of illegal immigrants talking jobs) & poverty.

"Even though I'm a white supremacist or at least employ many of them, have you seen your unemployment numbers?" is ultimately Trump's black voters outreach. Oh and also Kanye likes me.

. @ realDonaldTrump Not true. Unemployment still at record highs, reductions are not new jobs but return from furloughs, COVID still surging, retail up because shops reopening not because of growth, and you manipulate stock market by using our taxdollars to buy stock. A sham. # MAGA
Today, the national black unemployment rate is at an all-time low of 5.5 percent. Unemployment for black women is even lower, at just 4.4 percent. More importantly, the overall black-white employment gap is smaller than it has ever been.
Damn I wish i could file for unemployment, they just giving away free cheese

“Lowest unemployment”, but doesn’t count the large numbers of underemployed people: those working part time when they want full time, university graduates stuck in service jobs, and those who are working for uber/postmates/etc. And record salary and economic inequality.
People who are dying of Covid in the United States are not dying in vain, according to Trump, because the unemployment and jobs numbers are good.* *your definition of good may vary. https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1274114536358981633 …

Gave the blacks record high unemployment.
40 years of what exactly?!? If I’m correct on my history within the past 40 years, we have not had a global pandemic that has taken over 115,000 lives, unemployment rate worse than the Great Depression and civil unrest in the streets!! That’s all under this moron Trump!!
And it’s all thanks to unemployment

Hold on as oppose to the wonderful homeless paradise with overinflated taxes, corrupt majority democrat politicians with a dictator as their leader, record unemployment (not just because of corona..AB5 has a lot to do with it)...yeh red hellhole sounds pretty good.
Kinda wack that most of us are on unemployment and we can't hang out :///
This governor is a liar and corrupt no integrity and don’t care for Floridians.. Florida knows this now ! Unemployment isn’t working 3 months now . Was has the governor done NOTHING! All he’s done is lie to Floridians. U think he cares if Floridians can pay bills or get food. NO
Well, thanks for your rosy picture Donald! Retail has been record setting due to the fact that most folks are staying home more and need food for home! The virus is spiking in some states and is very alarming in a few, unemployment is still very high, and the DOW is tanking!
I believe it to be virtually guaranteed. Plenty of formerly middle income peeps are going to be on that supplement and they aren't going to like their below the poverty-line lifestyle that unemployment benefits is presently comprised of.
Biden is well known for as an excellent debater. Trump just bullies, has no facts, his health is visibly, rapidly declining. I'm not convinced Trump will go thru w the debates. By the fall Covid deaths could b over 200k, unemployment may be higher, and then there is the economy.
Meanwhile in reality 1.5 million more Americans filed for unemployment just this week
Lowest unemployment, school choice, funding for HBCU's, prison reform, police reform, first step act, oppurtunity zones, lower taxes, better trade deals, music modernization act. In 45 years what has biden don other than hurt the black community with the crime bill? CHOKE ON IT!!
If you can admit thAT PEOPLE GET MORE MONEY FROM UNEMPLOYMENT THAN ACTUALLY WORKING then you can figure out that PEOPLE ARE NOT PAID ENOUGH FOR LIVING WAGES
Your own article: $2 trillion bill provides direct cash payments to tens of millions of Americans, immediate relief to small businesses, and expanded unemployment benefits for some of those who are out of work. Like I said.
The US novel Coronavirus response wasn’t good. US data was greatly skewed by NYC/New York State. The ripple effects of closing down may have more profound consequences to more Americans than the number Covid-19 deaths. RE: 1000’s of KY STILL awaiting Unemployment Ins benefits.
As a whole, the figures illustrate the unusually broad nature of the recession, with all states enduring unemployment rates that soared in April as the coronavirus forced business closures. https://bit.ly/3ejfFFt

Lowest minority unemployment, booming economy, etc... You’ve forgotten about the blatant racism from the left. Trump wasn’t a racist until he ran as a Republican. Go watch CNN and get you daily TDS update.
Well those 120,000 dead arent strictly from the corona, 1/4 of those deaths are from New York, the unemployment is bc the country was shut down and people weren't allowed to work, before that unemployment was at an all time low
There are millions of US Stem workers like me looking for a job, unemployment didn't take into account those who have expired 6 months looking for job, it also didn't take into account 2 million stem workers who didn't get job and now working in other professions

That’s all bullshit. News is owned trash. Opportunity zones were TRUMP. HBCUs long term funding was TRUMP. FIRST STEP Prison Reform was TRUMP. Record low unemployment was tax/regulation cuts which were TRUMP. Save your owned leftist media opinions for your TV-watcher friends.
Statistically, mortality goes up with unemployment, & life expectancy goes down. Also, missed cancer screening, missed treatments considered non-essential, increase in drug & alcoholism, domestic violence is up... Those deaths are simply ignored as if they don't count.
TRUMP IS FOR BLACKS: Lowest Unemployment ever, School Choice, 4000+ Opportunity Zones ($100B), $360 million grant to support Historically Black Colleges and Universities, the First Step Act, Executive Order to stop chokeholds, and met with some families of dead Blacks.
And Trump is better? 121,384 Coronavirus deaths, nearly 4 trillion budget deficit, 14.7 % unemployment, almost 2.3 million Americans had contracted a virus which could have been avoided, the mighty US now the laughing stock of the world - ALL ON TRUMP’S WATCH!! Dumbass!

I remember when you said Obama faked the numbers on unemployment statistics. I'm wondering how fake yours are?
we're not reopening because we've given up. we're reopening because the government has ACTIVELY DECIDED that the loss of life is less important than (checks notes) paying unemployment. and conveniently they've decided that after seeing how the virus is not affecting white ppl

Stop tweeting and pass unemployment extension for the millions of us whose jobs aren’t coming back!!
Yes it does don't forget what 8 year. Of was like coal miners out of work. High unemployment let only the lies and corruption in our nation we people have power to do what we will wasn't the case with Obama

America is in danger because we have RACIST in the White house who are beyond corrupt !! Cutting heath care and unemployment during a PANDEMIC!! $650 billion unaccounted for. Hiding TAXES. Hotels and businesses in Russia turkey China not putting AMERICA first !!
In your world there's no coronavirus and 16% unemployment in the US? What world are you living in because it damn sure aint Earth!
It could be lower if people would choose to go back to work. I know several businesses who need employees but unemployment is paying more than minimum wage.
Record setting unemployment. Stores closing in every city and town across America. This is a bunch of .
None of that was trumps fault.I didnt realize he alone could stop a virus. Before Covid we had the lowest unemployment rate ever. And as far as for the deaths nothing could be done about that. And those numbers are inflated by around 25%. What was he supposed to do that he didnt?
Not untill July 31 when the CARES 600/week unemployment bonus runs out. Until then, we are funding the protests and riots.
FYI. Kentucky ranks: 44th in education 45th in health care 36th in unemployment 45th in family income 45th in life expectancy 49th in happiness 10 of America’s 25 worst counties to live in are in Kentucky. McConnell's annual salary is $193,400 His net worth is $22.4 million. Hmm
Everything is sooo in credible. We lead the WORLD by far in deaths. Unemployment is at record levels and you are bragging. You are going down in flames.
Sweetie, this administration has done more to help my income than any other. Many middle income Americans have been thankful for low Interest Rates, low Unemployment, new Homeownership, thriving businesses. Fact! Get yourself ready to lose again by a landslide this November.

I worked for 7 years at around minimum wage, and when I left work I chose not to claim unemployment because I had money. When I left Texas because I was promised work by @ 7eleven and promptly found that there was no job, I was denied unemployment because I didn't earn enough.

The extra $600 federal unemployment benefit won't be extended. That would conflict with Trump's alternative reality that the Covid-19 pandemic is over.
Thanks for the input. Now review his justice reform bill and tell me about the racist to the core part? Also why was he bragging about poc low unemployment as a good thing?

Well it’s only been to work for 5 1/2 months. And way to fire it when there’s only a few weeks left of federal $600 unemployment Marshall kind of a dick move. At least carry its healthcare through the end of the year.
Until recently the unemployment was the lowes in history. Everyone was working so the steady job argument doesn’t make sense to me. Wages are a problem, but higher factory wages has to come from the consumer.
The democrats need you to need those programs so they can be perceived as helping you but you won't necessarily need those programs when unemployment is down at 3.5% like it was before the virus. Trump wants to give you a hand up not a hand out.
Trending down on this graph is a good thing since its unemployment rate. The lower the unemployment rate the better
One of the dumber things about 2020 is that the unemployment department doesn't have enough employees to answer the frickin phones.
@ JoeBiden has passed the Tax Relief, Unemployment, and Job Creation Act, Budget Control Act, American Taxpayer Relief Act, Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, and Violence Against Women Act in his stand for the American People. What have you done, @ PYNance ?

Boohoo has a market value of £5bn. What’s also pretty suprising, and a large part of their success is how short it’s supply chain is. 40% of it’s cut price clothing ranges are made in the UK, that turn around time is unreal. Never needs to shed margin in order to clear stock

"I called the police but they haven't been much help.. I'm thinking about shutting down business until this blows over."
The country is open for business and isn’t game for getting shut down again. We need a new solution other than shutting everyone down again!
I don't get how shutting down the ports helps BLM. It this a revamped NO BUSINESS AS USUAL? Doesn't it just slow the economy and screw with people who trying to deliver goods to us? Support the movement, but don't see why it helps to shut down ports.
Survived another round of layoffs at my company today. For those who think the economy is back it's not and I'm hearing the same from my customers in various industries. This is exactly what Newsom wanted. Thousands unemployed and business shutting down # RecallGavinNewsom

Gotta help them do business instead of shutting them down and then sending in the looters when they open up.

It really isn’t a cold. I live in Arizona. They are shutting down business for quite a few establishments, because of employees becoming sick.
The whole point of shutting business was to avoid overloading the hospitals, yet no one seems to notice is not happening. So this whole thing is a very big mistake.
Opinion, if you’re permanently shutting down your business after only 3 months of being closed, you had bigger financial problems way before this pandemic started.
Well the one Corbyn suggested I was excited about because my business would have thrived instead of shutting it down and leaving the country And New Zealand one is pretty similar from what I've read EVs FCEV everywhere people trained to fix them. Solar powered houses powerwalls
It's all about getting people dependent on govt ... If it was about actually saving lives, they'd see that the COVID19 death rate is now lower than most other viruses and shutting down more business is ridiculous... Fake panic.
As # DominicCummings says " he doesn't care how it looks." # PPE brought from supplier aboard who has never made # PPE before, shutting out # UK business & professional staff who normal make # PPE. Wasting £250 million # uk taxpayers money on app that does work.
Cruise lines shutting down operations in U.S. Apple closing stores didn't conservatives trust business over govt?
That’s their problem, they think they can do whatever they want, wherever and whenever. Protest all u want but disruptive behavior should not be allowed. Shutting down freeways, roads and intersection, blocking entrance to business and such is not the way. Play by the rules.
But it’s none my business my finances are fine. I just don’t want to hear all the crying when we go into a second lockdown because Americans are idiots. We see places like Beijing shutting down for a second time over a lot less but we’re heading back to 30k a day and don’t care
Yes that's true Newsom has put business in a chokehold between shutting California down and mandating these masks.
I’m not shutting up unless somebody kills me. & I’m only going to share more & more of everyone’s business so buckle up

It's not about spreading fear or shutting the economy down again. It's about getting people to take this shit serious enough to at least wear a mask when they go into a public indoor business. If your credit card debt is going up each month ignoring it doesn't fix the problem.
I guarantee that wearing a face mask for a while vs. shutting down the economy again is more popular. Ask business owners?

It's a new day and one filled with increasing Covid numbers. Admit you screwed up (trump on your backside) and start shutting down business, ect. You have brought the virus to the good citizens of Florida a 2nd time around.
Shutting down is *NOT* safe. Consequences? Economic recession; job loss, business closures More domestic violence Skyrocketing suicide (attempts + success) Loss of access to medical care (hospitals refusing routine treatments) Increase in divorces Lack of kids' education

If there is unemployment today it has nothing to do with what you are saying. Its due to the country shutting down due to Covid-19. Actually the PPP program has helped many small businesses to be able to continue paying salaries to employees even if the business is still closed

It's not even about masks anymore. Shutting down small businesses and big businesses to stay open If a govt doesn't trust its business owners to implement safety protocols then that Govt needs to be removed He works for us! Forced unemployment is not okay. Abuse of power

Great! Does this mean I can sue Wuhan Grisham for the losses my business suffered due to her shutting down the state or is this only to punish cops?

Sometime being an ally means shutting up and minding your business.
Wait so he thinks shutting his business down for 3 months was political and not because of Covid.
Remember: Bonnie does health, you do the part where you balance health risks against risks to business, livelihoods, relationships, and all the other fallout from shutting down society. V Island has not had a new case since May 15 and has had zero active cases since June 4.
And imagine being the person responsible for a business shutting down and a couple of people out of a job. For not wearing a mask. I know there's no real reason to wear a mask but at the same time I don't want to be the first reason why a place got shut down.
So the Media says right? How boring you are. Everyone knows that is BS. The Media lies and shouldn't be in business because they make you ignorant. Try shutting that crap off and find alternative media, truth speakers.
I called JPMorgan and was like WTF are you doing? All they said is we thought the check was fraudulent. I said I have business accounts connected to my personal account. All you had to do is look at the business accounts, or give me a call, instead of shutting down my account.
This is also stupid business. A surge in cases will mean shutting down again.
Hope they enjoy shutting down again after they cause a spike in infections. I'm paying attention to businesses who put the health of their employees and customers first and those that don't. Those who don't won't get my business ever again.
You should dedicate your life to minding your business and shutting up but here you are anyways

well since they are democratic countries, sometimes conservatives win elections and roll back progressive policies. unfortunately distributism only really works in an agrarian economy. if you're up for shrinking GDP by about 97 percent then go for it.
Arts and Culture contributes $111bn to our GDP and was generating more revenue than the "mining boom" of 2008-2009. And that's with extremely poor funding that has been gutted by the govt over and over. Imagine the revenue we'd gain with proper funding.

I cite a bunch of studies in my book, The Fracking Debate, in the Econ chapter. # shamelessplug. The Greenstone paper is great on local benefits (and costs). There have also been some broad GDP estimates from academics and CBO in the range of shale adding 0.5-1% to GDP growth.
Yep and the covidiot wants them to spend 2% GDP on defense, that would be doubling their current budget.

I’m no expert Neil, just looked at their scenario planning and it predicts a recovery from the re-stimulation of the economy as emerging and debt to GDP ending the year at 95% ( predicting it would be over 100% about now). Seems about right tho they are readjusting downwards.

It's so one sided by stating that under Khan's government GDP growth fell without even addressing the fact that Imran Khan inherited a government on the verge of default with an unprecedented current account deficit.
While we’re at it. If Trump gets his 8 years. I’d bet you $1000 his GDP average will be a negative number.
You might want to check that GDP number you’re quoting... our economy did not grow 14% during the GFC
Sadly national politics is not organized around the economy as much as it should. Blue states mostly have much higher levels of economic development measured by GDP per person. Their political clout is constrained by our federal system - in the senate and the electoral college.
I saw an article where they said they have proportionality concerns. Somehow $1 of fabric is more burdensome than a 3-month lockdown that results in massive unemployment, businesses closing, hit to GDP, skyrocketing govt debt, dwindling savings, domestic abuse, mental health, etc

GDP growth and jobs added were higher in the last 3 years of Obama's than any of Trump's. FACT. And anyway, if Trump takes credit for people employing workers, then Trump takes the blame for 117,000 people dead of Covid. That's 39 9-11s under his watch. BAD.
By the way, the National Debt as it sits right now is over $26 Trillion dollars. Trump said when he was campaigning that he would increase GDP from 1% to 4%. End of FY19 it’s at 2.3%. Obama was able to to increase the GDP several times well over 3-4% throughout his Presidency.

Here’s how you work stats in your favour. A 6ft man was 6ft, 3 years ago. An 8 year old has grown by 1ft in last 3 years. That does not mean that the 6ft man has shrunk. See UK v Rwanda and how the EU has a lower % of GDP v RofW.
That's still kind of missing the mark. Denmark spent around 10,4% of their country's GDP. If the US was to do the same they'd have to bump around 2 trillion USD into the healthcare system. Not saying that's impossible or even a bad idea, just saying that its waaaaaaaay harder.

It also said that according to the 3 scenarios sanction may had a 60%, 40% or 30% impact on gdp growth. So there you go, fair and square. I said 50/50
For now it might be and realistically no one believes your gdp numbers anyway. The gap isn't as large as you say it is. Once business divorces from China India will be coming for you. They already destroyed your army, economy is next.! Go India! # CCPsucks # CCPvirus # CCPcriminals
You can't apply a fraction of GDP from 200 years ago, take the resultant sum, and directly apply it as a fraction of GDP today, and declare that there's no link between how those figures came to be. I never said it should be 100%. I nearly said it was associated. It's not 0%.
Dude as far as I know. We were never in fight. Specially with China odds r multifold. We r 6 times lesser in GDP. Our firepower is way less then the Chinese. Thanks to Congress. So what's the point of saying we chickened out. We are already lame .
Yes, 3% of China's export, ~75 Billions (~3% of our GDP). It won't dent in THEIR economy but it will have huge impact on OUR economy improvement, isn't it? Do you know 2.5% of GDP is spent on defense?
They're going to be found in making a society where people can live and create without having to justify their labor and lives through how much money they get; a society that isn't measured in GDP per capita and scarcity in the first place.

My last point. Today our defence spending as % of GDP as low as it was before China War in 1962. And we are getting same results on the field. Had we been part of some Alliance we could have justified 1.5 % of GDP as defence spending. But no we are not.....3
Not for me, 80m he cost. Gets turned to easy and looks vulnerable when players run at him - the lack of decent CBs worldwide means any that are semi decent cost the GDP of a small nation! Defending is a dying art.
I heard on the radio today and I hope I am repeating this correctly, that the level of country debt has now surpassed GDP for the 1st time since 1963, so I think we've already outweighed it like you say

By that logic if £1 was made from a slave in AD1500, 100% of GDP today has its origins in slavery. That robs the analysis of any force or meaning.

Yeah, basically sucking it out of the economy while producing very little GDP for the working class…what I characterize as a massive tax on workers output.
Not even going to have this convo when you want to just make things up. As for jobs, the economy gained a net 11.6 million jobs under Obama, and ~1M more than Trump at this same point in his admin. Make a GDP meme if you want.

The current systems really make no sense, with the utter focus on GDP. Even a measly 3% GDP growth per annum means doubling in just 24 years. Why the obsession of more money, and in particular for the already wealthy?
Also, the imbecilic Mexican president refuses to offer fiscal stimulus to the economy. Apparently the equation GDP = C + I + *G* + NX is far too complex for him to comprehend.

American police spending is hardly out of line with the rest of the world. In 2017, spending on police totaled 0.66% of GDP. Member countries of the EU spend an average of 0.9% of their GDP on the police, with individual nations ranging from 0.5% to 1.4%. http://cityjourn.al/2N9AgQL
I mean the positive impacts would be wages and whatever the contribution to GDP; but even that could be offset by employees’ reliance on means-tested benefits. Seems difficult to believe that the negative externalities don’t dwarf those benefits.

I think my point is that MRAPs don't float. Not much use in a flood, I'd imagine. And to spend what is very likely the entire village's annual GDP on a military vehicle not built for the application it seems needed for, seems silly.
Cute, but not accurate: Obama average GDP: 1.6% Trump average GDP: 2.5% You should really know what you're talking about before embarrassing yourself
American Scorecard - stop optimizing for GDP and start measuring and optimizing mental health, physical health, drug abuse, etc.
But Indian fighters are aimed at PLA, which cannot import any Western weapons. In other words China doesn't have advanced fighters like F35/F16. Therefore Russian fighters are more than good enough for India to defeat China. And it save money - India's GDP is only 1/5 of China.

We can recalibrate our goals to only measure what matters. Human development indices. What’s gdp when people are still being exploited? What’s gdp when so much work is being unaccounted for? Young people in politics, we need a new set of ideas. The old pipeline is broken, 4/x
This is the UN "urbanisation" model that people like George Osborne are fully signed up to. "London powerhouse" was about making Manchester a second London. Yes, it grows GDP which is the only stat they care about because they leech off the GDP. It isn't a good social model
Something I learned today: whilst the USA has a gdp per capita 50% higher than Europe, the average (median) European is richer than the average (median) American.
Economist Intel Unit Report predicts entire global economy will have a negative GDP growth of 5% by end of year. U.S. will have a negative GDP of 4.7% by years. We are looking at 2026 at restoring the global economy to its November 2019 position. you did this.
Basically all of the above. It is classified as an emerging market (low per capita GDP), but is large and powerful enough with massive population to be a major economic and geopolitical force nonetheless.
I worry we are front loading our health, with payback to come at the expense of kids and grand-kids. Austerity stopped being an option after 2008, I agree with that. By my numbers, the debt added from 2008-2019 should have resulted in +6% gdp, the 2.5% we saw frightening low.

Communism is so dumb that even China has mostly abandoned it. Private enterprise is 60% of China’s GDP, 80% of urban employment, 90% of new jobs, 70% of investment, and 90% of exports. It has lifted them from 88% to 1% poverty rate.
How much is $27 Billion? Numbers can be hard to visualise over a million, especially because million and billion sound kinda similar. So let’s go with a comparison. It is the GDP of Iceland.

I think the cause of a fall in GDP is more significant than the fact that the number falls. For instance, in a typical recession, the desired wealth/income ratio goes way up.

One thing that Trumpists love to focus on is GDP growthrate.. "look at how much better China is than US, we need to match that!!" Only, our economy is so large that we can never match that b/c as GDP grows, rate of growth is inherently slower. China will slow as they approach.
