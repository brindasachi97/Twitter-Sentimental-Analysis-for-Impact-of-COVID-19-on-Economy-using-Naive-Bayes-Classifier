Yeah, I'm based within a mental health team and welfare reform has been a massive cause of increased symptoms. Dread to think of not just the human cost but the actual financial cost on services. False economy.

70s the economy wasn’t great. It boomed for some in the 80s but it was “fake” money. Over borrowing, over lending, Ponzi schemes, Wall Street wolfs.
Will Waymo explore a vision base system like Tesla? Seeing how covid 19 is putting a damper on the sharing economy will Waymo pivot to building personal vehicles or license the tech to traditional car manufacturers?
Who? # Obama? That amazing president who fixed a broken economy? The # Obama who the is so threatened by? That # Obama? I like him. Met # Obama once. Nice guy.
@ POTUS please force the economy open! The healthcare system is collapsing due to NO patients Covid or otherwise and the economy you built is going into the ground. Please reel in these Democratic Governor “Kings” and make America Great Again!

I don't think we should ever go back to work. Shut down the unnecessary economy, tax the rich, the property holders and the corps until they are dry. Rent and food are free from now.

Sorry but @ realDonaldTrump owns this economy and the covid 19 response he ignored it for weeks lied about having it under control now he’s pointing fingers and blames China, Obama, WHO, Hillary’s emails, anyone he can think of besides himself.
Yes. They are intentionally destroying the economy in an effort to alienate Trumps base. It ain’t working!

Right, so you're working and now your agenda is to keep the rest of the country shut down so you can wreck the economy to hurt Trump and help Biden. Sorry but that strategy is doomed. Biden would have us locked down for years and accuse anyone who steps outside of 'terrorism'.

The one who served in the administration handed to worst economy since the Great Depression and left a strong economy to the next administration which is letting Americans die while the economy tanks. (Hint: It’s Biden)
Of course you would. Why not let the country go bankrupt and no one have a job. Not seriously thinking of the consequences, are you? Obama saved the GD economy, and Trump was benefiting from it until Covid.
I am amazed by "left" and their desire for economic collapse both here and in US and UK. I am absolutely not buying this concern about second wave. I think they know in strong economy nobody will be buying their Marxist garbage, so their only hope is economic crash. # auspoI
Even the middle are realizing they can bare four more years of your tweet storms because Biden can’t bring back the economy. Money in people’s pockets tends to make them happy. When they can afford to live life and enjoy themselves again.

i don’t understand your point, but the reason some states are shut down and others aren’t is because of what they value. some value the economy while others value human life. this isn’t a control thing, it’s a saftey thing. it’s a pandemic.
Joe Biden? I don't get it. Did he just endorse Biden because that's the only choice that is realistic. The economy has never been lower since Trump took office.

No we shut down the economy because the outcome of the virus was unknown and potentially very risky at that point. Because of measures in place we have reduced that risk.
It seems tome it’s up to the provinces to shut and open the economy. The Fed’s seem to be just a chorus in the background. Stop bloody well personifying ever damn thing by relating it to ‘Trudeau’, there is the PMO running things, with our elected cabinet snapping to attention.
You know that what you are telling people is fraudulent. This will not really save any lives and will further hurt our economy. We need to have policies to protect those at risk and treat those at risk early with HCQ and zinc. Your recommendations are nonsense and harmful.
we didn't shut down the economy over the deaths because they weren't prevented you simpleton. that makes less than zero sense. we shut down our economy over the amount of deaths that were prevented and we should probably let someone we trust calculate that. (so not you)

We're a low wage economy which is why Labour have increased the minimum wage, and included free training in building, agriculture, and manufacturing in the latest budget - but the NZ right aren't ready for that conversation.
But see that's the problem with that form of thinking is that the vast majority of the country needs it so it would be much easier to give it to everyone and have them spend it to stimulate the economy

Lionel. Never happen. Not for a Planned Deep State Event. Obvious why this is happening. Election in six months. "They" wanted the economy to tank and unemployment to surge. It won't work tho
If the economy is as bad as people think it is, maybe they should look at online auction prices. Holy high bids batman are people spending the money!
We we’re this excited about getting good toilet paper and paper towels. That economy class stuff is rough.
Wonder whether @ NicolaSturgeon now following @ BorisJohnson ? All because this might be calm before the storm & give public & economy a boost ? Cause there’s scientific info of a poss second wave in winter & freedom short lived ? @ piersmorgan @ afneil ? Thoughts ? @ GMB
Actually Valorant is really close to being a good game, they only need to: Make normal maps Balance weapons Balance characters Make better skins Make game faster Make economy changes Make game more new player friendly Optimize the game
IMHO the problem is, my cousins, that those that are doing good are too quiet. Those who are screaming about the economy and "just the flu" are likely to put us all at risk. I worry about what the next 6 weeks looks like in the hospitals as many try to return to "normal." Be safe
I can’t stimulate the economy if I have to wait in line everywhere I go or can’t even get in bc business hours are cut short @ tjmaxx @ HomeGoods @ ultabeauty @ realDonaldTrump @ GregAbbott_TX Can we go back to being the greatest country on earth yet?
The economy wouldn't be in the crapper now if you had PAID ATTENTION TO YOUR PDB's in December 2019 & January 2020. Major F up on your part Donnie...OWN IT !!
Yep fight that coronavirus with all that Military weaponry. We have the world’s strongest military and we have 90,000 dead with not a dam thing can be done about it . Strong military, world’s greatest economy and no one is SAFE!!!!!
@ realDonaldTrump needs to get us through this crisis and stop crying about China and how great the economy was before the virus and actually work on ramping up testing instead of hiding #'s because it may make him look bad. DO YOUR JOB!!! # WorstPresidentInHistory
A health economy and a robust equitable system of govt create jobs. What doesn't create jobs is bent politicians or insatiable corporate greed. The last people who should be involved in job strategy are compromised politicians and invested businesses.
How's he close? Well he's staked most of his gains on the economy (gone now) and is allowing more legal holes for immigration. Like that deal he signed at the end of 2018 that allowed sponsors and potential sponsors of minors to not be able to be deported
Italy and Spain had mass outbreaks first then locked down, too late, Sweden's economy is down as much as the US but death toll highest in Europe, what are you trying to argue?
I mean places should be working on inventing new ways to recover the economy. Not just we are losing revenue.
Scotty doesn’t have the brain power to explain the mechanics behind a good bean fart. Anything seriously discussing economics and the economy is way beyond his pay grade. Harvard my ass! He couldn’t clean the gym at that school. Wish I could pass this to him
I’m confused by your argument though. How is letting the economy tank going to benefit anyone? How does letting millions slide into poverty help when it’s unnecessary? We are a sovereign first world nation. We can use fiscal and monetary policy to the benefit of all.
That's all you have to say abt your fellow Americans, who are suffering and dying, plus the deterioration of our country's economy under the "leadership" of Trump? At this point, a cockroach would be a better POTUS than that demented racist you praise!
Science is not always Right.God is Right. We have to open the Economy to keep Americans great and happy. Trump 2020
Why worry about Clinton or Obama there a virus and a possible greater chance of a second wave, be preparing for it rather then political vitral. Even if you open economy , past presidents, have nothing or anything to do with what's happening now or into he future

Economy is overpowering science and common sense. We've seen this too many times before.
What do you want to do? Stay locked in the house all your life. That Robert Burns poem comes to mind. Ode to a mouse “wee cowrin tim’rous beastie”! TB pandemic kills millions worldwide every year. Do they shut down the economy for that and lock healthy people up? No they don’t.
“The economy was just steaming along, the stock market was firing on all cylinders and that jobs report was fantastic,” says Moore. “It was almost too perfect. Nobody expected this virus. It hit us like a meteor or a terrorist attack.” Really?
Which is why some people want the economy to open ASAP! They don’t want support nobody!
Giving small amount will not change their life situations. VOTING FOR CHANGE WILL! The last 3 republican presidents wrecked our economy. Trump did worst. He ignored warnings that a pandemic is coming. When it was here, he did not have a plan! VOTE OUT TRUMP!!!
No. It's fundamental now. What we need is to have these issues addressed in public discussion about re-opening the economy, lifting the lockdown, the importance of testing, tracing and tackling patients early to try to reduce the damage inflicted by the disease.
Keeping your People Healthy keeps your Economy growing and your Nation prosperous. Lessons Bequeathed to us by the Victorians. Too fucking bad trump & the GOP American Fascist Party NEVER learned this, much less figured it out. 100kDead by next week. # BringOutYourDead

I suspect he believed the economy was the only reason he had the support he did and was unable to recognize a new "opportunity" to garner support. Cynical, obviously, from a policy perspective, but also amateurish from a political perspective.

If your pandemic refrain is all about reopening the economy and getting people back to work, it makes zero sense to rip people who are *already working* and trying to take proper safety precautions.
Way to go. Your right. There is plenty of data and science to support it. So many are ignorant to the truth and buying into fake media. It’s easier for many to want to believe our own government isn’t involved in the destruction of our economy or covid 19
Of course not. He did nothing abt economy inn his administration too
You realize Obama inherited the white house with the economy on brink of recession and the auto industry needing a bailout, right? It took him awhile to fix it but if you look its just all positives. Now due to Trumps handling of the coronavirus you will see pain ..real pain.
Fact check: Coronavirus was already present in US when # Drumpf locked down the border. # Drumpf inherited a strong, robust economy form Obama. # Drumpf had 3 years to replace any missing healthcare stock. Fact check: Trumplicans keep trying to rewrite history.

Give me some examples in history of economy vs market divergences like that are occurring today. You can't pretend this is a normal thing right and happens all the time? Or fucking ever in history? This time is different?
Can you imagine how much worse it would have been with a weak Obama economy and you and your politically correct stool pigeons in charge? We would be locked down for 2 years and millions of Americans would be dead and the economy gutted for 10 years. GOP doing a great job.
The thing rarely talked about is the simple fact that consumer confidence dives to nothing in the middle of a pandemic. Vast majority will self isolate and not go out even if there is no lockdown...the only way to get people and economy going again is to have no active cases.
Are you saying the economy or more accurately the stock market was an artificial asset bubble created and kept alive by the Fed's free money?

35 million people and counting out of work. Worst economy since the Great Depression, on the way to being even worse than that. Great job electing Trump! Tanked the American economy in only 3 years! Oh, and hundreds of thousands are going to die because of him and his COVID 19!
The only hope our economy has is another round of Stimulus payments (perhaps for remainder of the year). Who spends money that doesn't exist? 90% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck, with a little bit of money here and there then it's brokesville. ADMIN needs to be smart now.
The US has the capacity to change the rules while the game is on. Unfortunately China can't do that. The US holds the game changer because they are like a backend user with universal rights. The US can cause considerable damages to Xi, his billionaires and the economy of China.
Xi should pick his battles wisely. D economy of Iran is now on life support thanks to US sanctions. D worst that can happen is that Xi can create an uncondusive eco system 4 US companies in China which could force them to leave. Trump has d capacity to cripple China's economy.
Can you elaborate on what is unfair about it? There are claims floating around that a universal benefit will disincentivize workers from participation in the economy, so I asked the people if they would be disincentivized by a universal benefit

As I said elsewhere, immigration is good for the economy. This has been established by economists. They take jobs that nobody else wants, they create jobs, and add to tax revenues.
I'm definitely NOT "Oh, screw the landlords!" Nor am I "screw the banks!" I'm just thinking how we can limp out of this and put our economy together again. All I can see otherwise is mass bankruptcy.

Of course as more testing is done, more will show positive. A few states already determined COVID has been here. Mortality rates will continue to decline (based on tests). Aside from being slightly more contagious, its the flu. Killed the economy over the damned flu.
because reporters are taught and then instructed by their bosses to not be critical, but rather to seek “balance” and get ahead. i think we’re starting to see the first glimmers of change, but the institutional inertia, especially when the bad economy threatens everyone, is huge.
no Obama. what it exposed is how shitty out economy is and how little Washington cares about us

The elders should stay at home and isolate until they feel safer. The rest of us should go back to work and live our lives. Many more lives will be lost by closing the economy for too long. It's not a binary choice, that's what the left seems to not be able to grasp.

I know to many shops that will not enforce this mandate. I will not step foot in those places. When the people get off their unemployment & we go back into a shut down, they will not be able to get that benefit again for a year. Funny, they don’t realize that.

Then you my friend have no moral compass, in the economy pre virus with lowest unemployment rate in History employers were hiring working people away. If your morality was frayed then you should have left, if you stayed then you didn't care and you are guilty by association.

When Trudeau Sr became PM in '68 he inherited a balanced budget. By the time he resigned in '84, Canada was in a recession with rampant inflation, massive debts & high unemployment. Mulroney implemented the GST to pay Trudeau's debts! Trudeau Jr is repeating the same failures!
Trump did or tried to do everything he promised in his campaign. Continuing to stop illegal entry into a country already drowning in the cost of paying for their own legal people in need. You cannot refute the number of jobs created, the tremendous drop in black unemployment.

Yeah. Forgot about that. I'm taking about extending unemployment beyond the virus crap.
Economic fundamentals were weak before the pandemic hit. Growth was slowing. Unemployment was rising. And inflation was chronically below target. Meanwhile net debt is up £1 trillion since 2010. What did the last interest rate cut achieve? Nada. Because we're in a liquidity trap.
Hes pretty garbage. I promise he hasn't been affected like people who are high risk. Notice how he said he "would" take advantage of unemployment. This guy never had to quit his job during this unlike millions of others.
So are you for or against people being able to continue to stay on unemployment if their jobs open up partially because they don’t want to be exposed like you guys?
I’m just throwing the math out here 2000$ a month for 36 million and those on average for unemployment checks are eligible already for 625 a week that adds up to about 162 billion a month it’s not very sustainable

You don't really need to achieve perfection: someone will always be out of the normal reach (although when that's few enough I guess you can just react to it generously). Immigrant flow slows when unemployment increases. It and fertility rate are basically the same labor pool.
You're right. Trump cares so much about society that he's gleeful people are dying so he can go play golf. That's the kind of care Republicans will have as their legacy. Highest number of deaths, highest unemployment. Winning!

If you blame trump for the unemployment numbers due to covid its probably because you hate Trump to the point of being glad people are dying. Your happy this is happening. At least admit it.
Dont worry, Americans will fire Trump and his cronies in November. Hopefully the pandemic unemployment insurance will still be in effect by then so they can collect extra $.

Of the states meager unemployment benefits, I will literally not see a dime for myself to buy food, necessities or anything of the sort. Rent in California is inescapably high, millions have lost their jobs and public funds are now channeled to rich landowners, this is theft.
Yeah all good until people in the sector are made redundant. But mass unemployment is great so long as you can afford to visit Queenstown eh?
Understood, but there inlies the problem, if unemployment is greater than your paycheck then u are not making a living wage, and u are poor or at the poverty line.

Based on weekly claims I calculate unemployment to be 27% using a civilian labour force of 155 million and a pre-virus rate of 4%.
I’m honestly not sure. I haven’t seen a sign of a stipend anywhere but I’ve seen others get 2? Also my unemployment claims have been certified for at least a month and a half and I haven’t seen anything from that either.
UM all of the jobs hiring right now seem like they're taking advantage of the unemployment crisis pretty bad... most notably Amazon, Healthcare Recruiting Agencies, Law Enforcement, and the US Military.
Unemployment has been in a fairly consistent decline since 2010, so in terms of unemployment I don't think that's true. Of course correlation is not causation so it could be any number of reasons: including the Iraq war which boosted the economy.
it's 100% too early for my work to be opening up (even partially) but I also haven't received a cent of unemployment money yet so... capitalism wins again girlies
Your heart does seem to be hardened. Saying people would rather take unemployment than work without any proof other than right wing propaganda. Seems like a cruel assumption to make
IF ANY OF THIS ABSURD BILL IS PASSED, ESPECIALLY AMNESTY & PAY OFFS TOO ILLEGALS, THE REP PRTY WILL NEVER RECOVER! WE HAVE OVER 10% UNEMPLOYMENT, SKYROCKETING DEBT ETC: CITIZENS//NATION 1ST
It's amazing the lack of self awareness all you have by complaining about Snell when bringing up the unemployment number when u guys risk nothing at all+no pay cut Your shows become a non stop showcase of white privilege that enables owners to keep treating ppl like commodities
Did you know the US has higher unemployment numbers now than the great depression? Stop f-ing around and get people jobs
40% of workers WOULD be making more. The real truth is, not even 40% of the unemployed have actually received a check. The unemployment office can’t even find staff to process the claims. This is a real shit show.
I have unemployment money waiting for me but no access

by now it is simple. No matter how looney the left is, it is undeniable that Trump alone has caused the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans (so far) because he did not want the stock market to go down. Even if they tolerated his ethical and moral issues, it's simple now.

The same dumbasses that are now complaining about a low stock market and high unemployment are the same dumbasses that want everyone to hide inside to prolong high unemployment and a low stock market! Yes the left is this fn stupid!

America I salute those about to die for Trump’s Stock market ( patriots everyone of them?)
Deficit was out of control. Debt exploded. Manufacturing was at a 40 year low. He still hasn't created the amount of jobs that Obama has. Every economic indicator was pointing to a downturn....except the Stock Market.

@ AsaHutchinson Office depot is closing because of shutting down small businesses. Who ever heard of a Republican destroying business? Did you really help the Citizens of this State?
No admin has had to fight off a pandemic where the governors shut down all private business that they deemed non essential & all to stay indoors, has had the WHO misinform early on, media criticize as racist for shutting borders later criticize for not doing it fast enough.
Flu = Business as usual + vaccine Vs Covid = shutting countries down It should not be a surprise that drastic measures worked. The lower death rate vindicates the strategy.

Unfortunately the communists (Cuomo n company) can order these lockdowns legally. The key word the court has always deffered to: is it "reasonable" to suspend the bill of rights. So the court will decide if masks, lock down, shutting business was reasonable.
Why can't the Michigan National Guard or the State Police arrest them? They have no business shutting down the MI legislature or terrorizing the governor. Bunch of assholes and wanna be soldiers.

No thats a bad idea . Lets be quick to convert our mode of poeer for our cars from fossil fuels to electric but i see no use in shutting london down for business because some cranky kid from sweden says we should .
Actually, no. When there is an Executive Order shutting down your type of business you DON'T have the right to open up and damn the consequences. She was breaking the law plain and simple.

You are shutting down your state to hurt the economy so you can hurt the President and force mail in voting to cheat. We know what you are doing. It's sick. You are destroying the lives of small business owners and hard working people on purpose. You're an evil, corrupt man.
@ amazon you guys are actually awesome. Whilst every other business was slowing down, shutting down, had we sites that couldn’t cope, or placing stupid restrictions; Amazon stayed the same. You have me as a customer for life
Can't suspend them indefinitely. Then we have another crash. Also, many small business owners and folks who have had their pay slashed didn't qualify for a stimulus check. Won't prop up the economy. The root cause is shutting down the economy. Fix the root cause.
Do they really expect us to believe that the wealthy Democrats shutting down business are cleaning their own mansions?
The quarantine/lock down benefits massive corporations, amazon, microsoft, facebook etc etc, while hurting small individuals and small business owners. The elites benefit from shutting us down. But of course i'm a crazy conspiracy theorist for pointing out this basic obvious fact
You are seeing companies go bankrupt sitting closed or shutting doors for good every day. Owners of small business at least want a chance rather than die paying bills for doing nothing
The low shipping rates are a direct result of tyrannical governors shutting down business.

Shutting down all small business but supporting the major Dem donors
Great. But! Your last in the nation stance on opening up for business is DISAPPOINTING. Hindsight is 20/20. But knowing what we do now shutting down everything doesn’t make sense. We should have focused on vulnerable. We know better now. It’s time to get Everything moving safely
Right a lunatic. All we see and hear are crazies from the left. Even if you don't love Trump he's offering steady leadership. The democrats are calling for socialism, calling everyone a racist, pushing Chinese propaganda, and shutting down every small business That is lunacy.

Not only that if those business owners had read they recommended, not that they are shutting down. How it's why Best Buy was still open. Tattoo shops could have found a way as salons and barber shops. That's on the owners not the states or city.
Propaganda. If Sweden chooses to remain open for business it is none of your concern. You surely would not like Sweden telling NY or the US what to do? In the long run shutting down does nothing to contain the virus and only hurts the society and economy.

We are pretty close to contagion, business shutting down, state to state travel shutdown, idk if it’s over but if it got any worse we’d really be in the movie
No, not at all. And I don’t even know anyone that knows anyone. I think that’s proof that while some areas are infected, others aren’t and shouldn’t require the same amount of lockdown. Also, there are treatments. I’ll take that risk versus shutting down my business.
How to beat the corrupt government. Open your business, Don't pay your local tax or federal tax. Pocket all the money. Pay your employees. After all according to the illegal shutting down of your business you shouldn't be responsible to pay their taxes. # WaAreAmericans
Translation, they put the people 1st and tried to give more money to the small business than the large corporations. They're trying to save a federal institution from shutting down. And trying to give proper medical care to the people locked in cages! It's a "do right" list
Unfortunately the whole working force is feeling it Many black have already lost their jobs because companies are shutting down. Even way before the lockdown. And the lockdown made matters worse not just for tarven owners but car guards, small businesses, other black business
I'm on Team Trump, but I can't keep resurrecting my business after shutting down for 3 months, everytime China has an " oopsie" in a lab. The Dems controlled the narrative and fear on this and caused a tremendous amount of economic loss.

If the new normal involves Communism, total surveillance over everyone, living in fear, shutting down small business, people dying of poverty, starvation, disease, and suicide, then I want no parts of the new normal.
Protect everyone by quarantining the sick & vulnerable, & letting the healthy keep earning a living. Quarantining everyone & shutting business down only temporarily protects the vulnerable. Eventually, they're harmed by the economic destruction too. IDK why you can't see that.

"Safety measures" is the government shutting down your business indefinitely? People like you are a danger to liberty.
Shutting down our businesses, fining or arresting people for trying to go to work while releasing sex offenders (because they're more worried about the prisoners getting sick than the business owners). Leaders quarantine the sick Tyrants quarantine the healthy
The first package led to millions of people getting fired. When you tell employers the govt is shutting you down and you had to pay your employees- small business owners had to fire people. Dems don’t understand business.

Someone, anyone explain how they cannot get this done. By them going out of business for shutting these services down, they are essentially admitting incompetence to be able to manage the slightest change in procedure and account for basic safety measures. How is this possible.

production continues to move East which means their GDP will continue to rise. While the US plays red or blue politics, China remains resolute and determined. No policy inconsistency because it’s always the same people in power. Sometimes democracy slows you down.

The other consequence of that—besides that immigrant flow and fertility are a total sum and offset one another in the long run—is that immigrant labor produces and consumes, so increases the host country GDP (more labor hours, more production), but not GDP per-capita.

Too bad you ignore facts which include shrinking unemployment beginning years before with Obama, job creation as well and (Trumps favorite) a booming stock market. GDP? Three years in he couldn’t hit 3.0 annual as he promised. Didn’t built shit, beneficiary of recovering economy
It not that far from the Republican and Trump tax bill 85% of which went to companies and people like Trump. No trickle companies bought back their own stock. Of course Donald borrowed over 2 Tril and it didn't help the GDP. Obama has had higher GDP's.
Sir, GDP growth in Q4 ‘19 was 2.1%, 2.3% for full year. Public, corporate, household debt all record highs. Income inequality worst since 1920s. Low unemployment and stock market were good, but it was not the best economy ever. It was a nice long run started under Obama.
Right. Wear a mask to (hopefully) potentially keep it from spiking again and avoid future lockdowns. Seems like a simple calculus to me. And yes, enforce the mask in the name of the GDP.

Damage is done. 2007 had a -4% contraction in gdp with economic activity level of 96% yet still led to 10% unemployment and recession. At this point we need 98%+ return in economic activity to obverse a similar level of economic pain. Opening up may mitigate pain but damage done.

Well, Donnie, you see one of the factors they use to determine it is GDP, and so every time you attempt to take jobs and businesses away from China and towards the USA you increase America's GDP and lower China's and thus you increase America's UN contributions and lower China's.

It’s also possible that real gdp in US goes down if people are getting out of USD but not to the same degree out of other currencies. In such a case the US market shrinks in real terms and so that would impact US focused stocks

Dying wildlife, GDP, collapsing economy—We didn’t start the fire! by Charlie The Australian wild fires were one of the worst tragedies in recent history,
Sweden's Q1 GDP was -0.3 q/q and +0.5% y/y, so not quite the same as the eye-watering drops in Europe. Services PMI for April at 40, versus low teens in Europe. Most deaths were in care homes, which was definitely mishandled. But overall, definitely upsides to Swedish model.
I can say the same about Trump. His GDP has fallen. My point: it has been over 3 years & Trump has not exceeded Obama's GDP growth n 2015. In the best damn roaring economy in the world as you say. While we have a revenue shortage & increased deficit of -27%. In a great economy.
Isn't reinvestment based on more borrowing? Austerity was because we had violated the EU stability and growth pact in 2008 Our deficit had to be cut from 10% to 3% GDP which was not met by the 2015 deadline so was reset to a 2017 deadline 1/

When I heard this I was immediately puzzled. BCs annual GDP is $300ish billion. Prorate 27 billion to the year and you get 160 billion in lost revenues. Say the share of value add to revenue is 25% then that's $40bn - 13% of GDP. That's way too high when Van is 14% of BC pop.

It's less than 3,5% of worldwide GDP. I often hear that 2,2% of Co2 emissions (without contrails) is neglictible, so I guess aviation is not worth helping economically neither.
birthday with 22 million people killed. Later in the year, a Spanish Flu epidemic hits the planet and runs until you are 20. Fifty million people die from it in those two years. Yes, 50 million. When you're 29, the Great Depression begins. Unemployment hits 25%, global GDP drops

Annual traffic fatalities, including pedestrians, is about 40,000 That's some 30x smaller than 1.25 million. (which seems low, given an IFR of ~1.1%) And, actually, we do spend a large fraction of our GDP on car safety—spending, without which, many more would die.

Forget whiteboards and Powerpoints, VR is going to digitize offices that have struggled with digitization: construction, architecture, manufacturing. They heavily rely on prototypes and 3D data. Zoom is not productive enough. Unlocking remote work for them has huge impact on GDP.
I think they'll take a macro lens. Look at each industry and see how sales have increased or GDP. Just like we can see "retail is down 12%" well just look at that. They'll also monitor unemployment. The infusion of cash was also to keep these layoffs temporary

MAGA talking points. According to the BLS, Trumps avg q/q GDP is 2.6% over last . Unemployment was 4.7% when he took office; Pre-CV19 it was ~3.8%: BFD. Your microscopic tax cut got eaten up by inflation. As far as racist attacks, the Arians think Trump has their six. I wonder Y?

Agree. Question is do our governments want us to save more or spend more. I think they want us to spend more as they measure their chance of re-election on an increasing GDP figure. As for currency depreciation, exporters would rather have a weaker pound.
How?? Maybe take an economics class. During a world wide recessionHarpers worst deficit was 3.6% of GDO. Not really comparable to the consecurive 7.6% and 7.9% deficits of # PET. @ JustinTrudeau's is a mere 12.7% of GDP .. a paltry $252.1 Billion. 5x what Harper did.

Quite. It’s not hard to understand....GDP drops = revenue to treasury drops = public services sold off (NHS) or budgets cut (Education). Add to this the rw idea that you don’t spend money educating your future doctors, teachers etc but import them and you’re left with a serf U.K
Most of what is said about the concept of Austerity is a myth, yes. For a start we have higher than ever NHS spending per capita. Then public spending as a percentage of GDP was only lower for one year than pre 2008. Oh, also I literally tried to volunteer... Have you? pic.twitter.com/pd5UPHEzGo

GDP is a measure of production. The nhs is publicly run, its expenditure is included in GDP(around 9% of UK GDP). If all production was owned by the state, 100% of GDP would be public expenditure. I don't see your point.
