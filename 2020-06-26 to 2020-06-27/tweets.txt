I also don’t believe the big spike in positive test results for COVID-19. I don’t trust the test and why wouldn’t someone try to manipulate it to hurt the economy and the President. They’ve tried everything else
Blaming lockdowns for the economic impact is speculative. How many people would be out at bars and restaurants if we just let the virus rip? Bottom line is an economy comprising tech and wall st. Billionaires and their Uber drivers and bar tenders was never sustainable.

Senator Graham should let the President handle the economy and concentrate on doing his job as the Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary.
That is true, but lets be honest he mis-managed the whole situation and had an itchy trigger finger to re-start the Texas economy. I just compare it to other states that didn’t do that. BLUF we would probably be in the same spot with the economy, but with much less cases.
Is it totally crazy to consider that this might have all been the result of a diabolical collusion between Chinese friendly Democrats & Communist China? Hillary loving Dr. Fauci was the one to issue the lock down. China wanted to harm the U.S. economy because of Trump's policies.

How pandemic is going to crush economy next yr is such an ignored story especially with this resurge. City, states, counties, school districts build a lot. They're still doing projects already funded before pandemic but that will halt soon. And commercial real estate is toast.
It also hurts our own economy here in the EU but here people are more important than €€€€. Anyway, I'm not planning to go on vacation in the US as long as Trump or the GOP is in power. I'll spend my money elsewhere.

I’m not even talking police departments. But how everything works together. From the government to our economy all the way down to education.
And she's not even yellow!
I don't see why trad aesthetics and a community-based or planned economy have to be at odds at all. if we've got enough in our Make Stuff Pretty budget to build fuckin' cathedral-style office buildings, apartment buildings, homeless shelters, we do it!
This point can’t be stressed enough. The only hope our economy has is for the government to spend. And to do so massively. Govt cuts takes money *out* of the economy. Govt “debt” is a myth and can easily be written off. The neoliberal lie is unwinding. # MMT # auspol # lostdecadehttps://twitter.com/Phar_Kinnell/status/1276485066202288128 …
Economy only works if we have healthy people- virus' gonna break it either way. Reopening gets us more sick/dead - staying in causes econ to wither. There is only threading the needle to reopen with measures. (Masks, distancing, limiting clusters in enclosed spaces, etc)

You know that best economy in 50 years? You need to thank @ BarackObama for it. Not Fat Donnie.
He didn't build shit, he inherited the economy, just like he inherited his wealth. Now you're excited that he's dumbing down the government? Shouldn't we incentivize people to get educations? I mean I know intelligent people spells doom for the GOP, but aren't we America first?
The EU banned Americans from traveling there. Russia paid the Taliban to kill Americans. COVID-19 cases are increasing. Our economy is still tanked. Our Judicial department is crooked under the current AG. Solutions to systemic racism are rubber stamped by Senate. # TrumpOut2020
Pandemic. Uprising against police brutality. Depression era unemployment. Destroyed economy. Lost standing on the global stage. Trump’s focus? Protecting lives? Jobs? No. Protecting statues of traitors. Vote.

It goes beyond UCT. On Redi show Gareth called a whole PhD student intellectually bankrupt & non contributor to economy. The total disregard of blacks & disrespect of even the excellent blacks is white supremacy. Once a white shuttle driver called me different & smart
Inferior to who??the way you have been clowning yourself in this thread is unreal tbh...you talking bout inferior...isn't it your people that kill foreign blacks in your country out of the fear that they will take over your economy and working population?ignorance isn't bliss
you and those stupid tests are wrecking our economy
You mean he built an economy where every rich entitled pick (and prickess) could rob the country of as much money as they wanted and the rest of us would pay them? You aren't just ignorant, you are stupid as well
Funny how the spike in numbers comes just after the economy starts up again. Its almost as if the higher up Dems and Libtards realized that it is too soon for that. The last thing they want is the economy to recover before November 3rd.
Just the democratic government in PA trying to ruin the economy so Trump doesn’t get re elected. It’s that simple.

Nice try, fellow Duck fan 3% unemployment: Never achieved, until MY President allowed Our Free Enterprise to succeed. Prez 44 had no clue about economy, because he was a simple community organizer
You know what's a political statement? The president of the United States downplaying the severity of Covid-19 and his eagerness of reopening the economy. That's a political statement. Not wearing a mask. And we heard that shit loud and clear. He puts profit above people. Period.
We didn't have best economy in 50 years regardless. Did you forget Clinton surplus, average 3.8 GDP and growth every quarter. FFS
NY had massive protests for weeks with people in the street and the numbers did not go up. This means that closing down the economy for months was a complete waste.
JB your is very detailed & when you turned bullish on CNBC was very funny but I agree with you. During GFC economy declined by 3% we wont be back to precovid life even by 2023. It's sad this is election year hence no federal lockdown but governors & mayors may close locally.
Holy shit and there it is! You finally admitted it. At least I know now that there are people who want to see the economy collapse and Americans die... and they vote for trump haha
So no more hysteria. Hold the politicians to account for destroying our economy and livelihoods. Open up and build back better and don’t write another piece that isn’t fact based.

what good is anything when yall keep shutting down the economy you guys are idiots
We’ve all but shut down interprovincial travel in our country, and our international borders remain shut. State 1 reopened on May 19, we’ve seen a steady decline and that was a huge chunk of our economy we reopened. Again, no spike, just the opposite.
If Trump better managed this virus we wouldn’t have an economy in shatters. Trump is prolonging the pain with his failed leadership.

Ed. Relax. You can’t pin the president success on one issue. Ya the economy was great. But his lack of leadership and insane deviousness - is not w winning strategy. Leaders lead. Small minded meg blame others.
We went through WW1, WW2. The Depression, recessions. Fix the economy and they will all come back. The coronavirus will not stop people wanting to ski, hike, hunt, see nature and so on. Money and if they can afford it is the only factor.
Show me how much MN is testing compared to TX. How many of the cases are positive antibody not COVID-19? Closing the economy kills people now and later while allowing the greatest transfer of wealth again like under Obama. Imagine if millenials had to storm Normandy?
oh yes. i forgot. thank you god for our amazing president trump. our economy is so perfect right now. nothing to do with the natural curve our economy fixes/destroys itself on. our presidents affect the economy so so much! it’s not like it’s the people who are buying and selling.
yes our presidents (Reagan) ignored the AIDs crisis, dismantled the economy, illegally sold weapons to funnel money to fascist death squads in LatAm, and (Bush) lie to the country to illegally invade another country and murder 1M people and then tank the global economy.

It is the green economy that must bring us back from the dirty economy. We can divert our efforts to recover by shifting economies to green energy rather than putting Humpty Dumpty back together again. Remove oil and coal and economy can shift for our children now.

Phil dont worry! This is the BLM spike. BLM protesters are being told by organizers to get tested to intentionally spike case numbers. BLM protesters are packing testing centers, not b/c they are worried, but just to shut the economy down. Flood the data w/ asymptomatic cases!

The war did much to help the economy out. However, from 33 to 41 unemployment dropped from 33% to 9.9%. He also dealt with the Dust Bowl which wiped out millions of acres of farmland. Plus he dealt with a global war that cost the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans.

Sure Don. We understand. Life’s tough these days. 125,000 dead American due to COVID-19 on your watch. The economy is a disaster & re-opening the economy failed. Millions are unemployed. Your Tulsa rally was a bust & Biden is polling much better. Just ask Mike for a pardon.
Here’s an idea: how about in the next stimulus package, we pay people who wear masks? If you don’t wear a mask, you don’t get a stimulus payment. If you do, you get a check. Because the idea, after all, is to boost the economy, right?
Has anyone in # econtwitter explored this possibility? Probably not since you and us data scientists are all motivated primarily to optimize the gig economy within its narrow definition as a flexible workforce of contractors.

You want the economy to open earlier? Wear a mask. You want to flatten the curve? Wear a mask. I genuinely don't understand why anyone is rebelling against wearing a mask. It's not political, it doesn't affect your freedom, & there is ample science that shows it helps *everyone*.

That economy started with Obama (Trump tanked it by bungling COVID), and appointing judges rated as unfit by the American Bar Association is hardly bragging rights.
"Will somebody w access to the Oval Office read the WSJ editorial “The Trump Referendum” to President Trump. We won’t hv more good scotus justices or the best economy in 50 years like we hv had if he doesn’t follow that advice"
If we’re deflecting blame and doing victory laps then we can go ahead and thank Obama for that economy.

So true. If you want to continue to have the economy open we need to stay healthy. We need to wear a mask at all times when in public correctly not below our nose. We know how to do this, let’s do it. The more we open the more necessary this becomes. Also socially distant. Smart.

Trump is businessman understands very much millions of jobs just came out trump made the best economy in our history.
Shut down the economy based on "official" numbers on the rise to keep everyone safe.Daily testing is up with a steady decrease of new cases along with an increase of "resolved" cases. Yet, based on these same "official" numbers people still screaming we're "opening" too early Wtf
Trump think if he just ignores the coronavirus it will miraculously go away, the economy will return to pre-coronavirus condition and he will win re-election. What an idiot!
Agreed. But the same pathogens tend to behave similarly in same-same environments. Again, our healthcare system is equipped to handle the influx now. And to be clear, the demographics at high risk should definitely shelter in place. Our currency and economy are priority now
They're just fresh out of ideas. What they should be doing is buying infrastructure bonds and forgiving those debts to give the govt a free supply of money to boost the economy. It would create jobs, inflation would tick up and people would start investing/spending again.
That wall has always been there.He’s refurbishing it. No he hasn’t created more jobs for Americans, it starts from years of hard work to reach that point. Jobs dontappear the next day cause he won. That’s BS.people signed contracts before he came into office the the economy grew

alright, let’s say we did decide to just sacrifice 3% of our population for the economy. no masks, total reopening. 1 million people dead. do people really think that won’t impact the economy?????
The pandemic should have taught people - especially politicians, especially Tories - that economy and society are fundamentally interconnected. There can be no economy without society. But politicians and corporations will not learn this, because greed makes them blind.
China is the number 1 threat to the west. A $14t economy and a desire for global hegemony. It ain’t good and it’s real.

Without clear leadership from the top, it's a lost cause. A long, slow burn of covid throughout the economy will prevent us from recovering. Until a vaccine (and that is not a given). We missed our opportunity to lock it down and kill it.
Here is my point if wearing a mask opens the economy up -- then whatever lets do it until a vaccine is out.
In hindsight, yes. But I also think we had to give it a shot. A completely shutdown economy and shut-in populace is also a recipe for disaster, so a good middle ground is re-opening with adequate testing, tracing, and prevention.

I think they’re (EU) are careful and concerned to come right out and ban the US. Trump won’t take it well but also won’t accept responsibility. It will also affect our economy should the EU announce it. Or shall I say, when.
What information on the economy that is not publicly visible to anyone might China need from the US? It seems far more likely that the US sends spies to China to figure out how to deliver 12% economic growth for 4 decades, enabling it to become a global economic power peacefully.

So this is your distraction from the thousands for coronavirus victims growing exponentially and the protests continuing to grow, unemployment continues to grow. You are evil, pathetic, and there is a special place in hell for you and your lot of enablers.

We must keep on to this re woman not re employed because they will do there best to make the unemployment look less and another thing people have not noticed that I did one on 14 homes mortgages on hold do they realise I could’ve pay back the arrears
When H1N1 was an epidemic were you on Twitter saying the US released the virus? Privatizing schools directly decreases funding for low-income schools. And you’re really going to bring up unemployment? In graphing, you n is what a trend is, right?
Uneployment will keep rising because everyday there are more people and less jobs. Hypothetically you could make people work less hours to have the unemployed fill the rest. However that would mean paying less. There you will fix unemployment but everybody is poor.
Another vacation in the middle of epic unemployment- and WE pay for it!! # VoteOutTheGOP # TrumpIsLosing
That's true the economy is not zero-sum, which means it is equally likely in this hypothetical scenario that there is only growth and no unemployment problems beyond what is normal. It is even possible that unemployment goes down.
You mean the record high unemployment levels? Those aren’t a fluke either
Hey .... if you’re receiving your unemployment or any other benefits on a government issued prepaid card .... transfer your Money to your personal account or take it off the card. A LOT of fraud happening with those cards.

hes not being paid to be our president, That's 100k a year. He made sure china isnt ripping us off no more. He brought back business and got unemployment % down further then any president or politician ever has. Minimum wage increase. Tax cuts. Transperancy.

By prioritizing economic recovery, Abbott sabotaged economic recovery. The bar staff were receiving federal bonus COVID unemployment & bar owners were saving their PPP $. Now they used their PPP $ to reopen, staff lost out on 6 weeks of feds bonus COVID unemployment.
The Dems lied to you to get Obama elected. Did not do anything he promised for minorities, unemployment was at all time high for minorities. Bombed 7 countries in 8 years and gave billions of dollars to Iran & they killed Americans with weapons they purchased with that money.
Good explanation. If # MoscowMitch not defeated the ACA will still be in danger. Trump is promoting his failure as president as a success. The Con goes on. Thousands of Americans died, unemployment at all time high, but it’s not the genius (donald) fault. No trump, it’s # PBO fault
If you have a problem with people hitting these unemployment licks block me. Y’all too rich for me.
Black unemployment is at 16% and rising, you can't hire these Americans and train them? You are the reason this country has all these disparities. Too thirsty for cheap foreign labor, that is unAmerican.

Well I suppose one way to get people back to work is put those that are working in hospitals or morgues by not wearing masks. It’s one way to effectively lower the unemployment rate and make the economy look better for @ realDonaldTrump ?!
Yes, imagine how much more unemployment there would be.
Is anything done right in Florida? Drive thru testing here took 3 mins. Unemployment check deposited into acct in one week. Haven’t seen one food bank line. Voting takes <10 mins. Get rid of your governor and your senators.

Okay let’s go back to the original question and my reply it was trump has the lowest unemployment rate with far more people since 2020 which means more people has money and our economy is better than before yes Obama and presidents before helped this great country.
I definitely have NO argument for that. Thank you. The hate doesn’t cut it. There is a real problem w/this crap and ppl trying to work and pay their bills. I’m pretty sure the ones w/the hate comments are laying out on their lazy f’ing asses collecting unemployment.
The fuck you mean be salty? I’m not salty about SHIT other than people are getting paid more to do less. Unemployment isn’t always the best out, especially for someone like me who works overtime to make up for the low pay level
Have you bothered to look at US unemployment rates recently?
Hello, I’m the leader of antifa, but they furloughed me back in March. Having a lot of trouble collecting unemployment since the Soros money was all under the table for years. Anyway, its all run by interns now.
Im not trying to be rude. I’m also considered “essential staff” but aren’t you grateful to be working at all? Some people don’t have enough to feed their families because unemployment is so backed up and some are going long periods of time without any income. Why are you
I will never feel bad for scammers. Especially ones that steal unemployed peoples stimulus/unemployment checks. Idc how poor you were growing up. Most of us came from a poor background and chose not to steal. I don’t feel bad for Hushpuppi

Imagine what the people could do if the dope was stopped in this country. You want unemployment and violence to decrease? Get the people in poverty you all ignore off dope you all allow in and stop the alcohol sells. All this government cares about is money.
ACA has already taken away health care, spiked deductibles and premiums, caused mass cancellations when their insurer leaves the program. And the party that's deliberately shutting down the economy for political purposes has no business talking about unemployment numbers.
So destroy NASCAR and our flag and EVERYTHING AMERICAN? I BET YOU LIKE THE FREE FOOD AND UNEMPLOYMENT CHECKS AND FREE CLINICS AND THEN ITS ALL JUST FINE, RIGHT?
Thank you for sharing our information on how people can receive their unemployment benefits!
There's been no word yet from @ GovAndyBeshear administration on how to make appointments for in-person help with unemployment benefits. When it comes, @ WDRBNews will pass it along. The appointment-only assistance is supposed to begin Monday.
When are you gonna give people their unemployment check? How are people suppose to do quarantine if they cant pay for basic needs?
I'm sick of my boss trying to fire me in the most non direct way possible. Dude it's obvious you don't like me for whatever racist or white nonsense reason. Say it to my face, I'm gonna make more off unemployment anyway and im tired of you looking for any way to be upset with me

No, ONE party agrees. The other is likely desperate enough to take it, especially @$15/hour and high unemployment. You act as if it's a fair deal - at lower wages it's the employer that holds the power. It is not a negotiation, because there are 10 more waiting for that job.

Not sure I'm extracting what you're intending me to. You seem to have your supply and demand positions backwards. Demand for workers increases, followed by supply. If you increase supply of workers first, you just get more unemployment and lower wages for those working.

And unemployment is available for anyone that can prove they are losing money due to the pandemic. I only think this is important because we have to hold each other accountable for the benefit of everyone. It’s not an individual decision anymore it effects everyone. It’s a virus
And yet people still dying from COVID, the south is spiking, unemployment is sky high, and racial tensions are awful. Yep. Statues are real frickin’ important.

I realized (after I heard a @ WPR news story about it) that this week’s deluge of calls to the unemployment office was probably due to a new policy announcing another round of assistance funds. So maybe it’s not *just* a backlog from March? Sorry to hear about ur furlough though.

hi can you address the unemployment situation many of us have not heard anything back despite months of waiting.
Money reduces human suffering too. Where’s that unemployment? Or the plan to get our kids educated while you keep the state locked down into the fall?
How? If that's the case then why has unemployment been such a persistent issue? I've understood this to be a supply/demand issue regarding the number of jobs available versus the number of people looking to be employed.
Should be no “could” about it. The only way to stop the stupidity is to remove those still thinking it’s okay or funny. There’s no audience on the unemployment queue.
Finally got unemployment check
Man. The Government needs to either send out another stimulus check or provide Universal Basic Income because a lot of people are not receiving unemployment and are barely hanging on to their homes, cellphones, internet/wifi and food to get by.
Combine that with liberal free speech laws, a decent unemployment rate, and lots of creative folks and it makes for quite a scene. And now I'm nostalgic for Stripperoke.

Is Texas shutting down businesses limiting in other ways such as amount of people in business, masks etc
Says bunker Joe, the progressive liberal socialist Democrat who accused Trump of racism and or xenophobia for shutting down air traffic to China and to and from Italy etc.!

@ POTUS stop shutting down small business and hiring yourself in 2020. Shutting down business is violating business constitutional/civil liberties! Pudding voters off! Tuning against yourself is killing your re-electing!
The costs to operate a business in Harvard Square have been out of control for years and without the constant student, staff, and tourist traffic many shops are shutting down for good, including Dickson Bros Hardware, one of the last long-standing non-chain stores in the Sq. https://twitter.com/thecrimson/status/1276576671638880265 …
Agreed. Business licenses are the way to enforce. Combined with shutting down parks and beaches and other public amenities if no mask compliance.
I can understand shutting the bars down. But, shutting down the Restaurants with a 51-50 Liquor License is insane. They were barely getting by and following guidelines. Now your going to put them out of business. Totally wrong.
Still contact tracing is unconditional period ... Abbott is full bore on this and shutting business once again this is devastating to a fragile economy...
He has a point but forgot about history. History taught us that these same practices from shutting business, churches and schools wearing masks and social distancing works well. It also angers people. Research 1918 like I did and you will see. Ignore it and that's not my problem
Actors are not a special case I'm afraid, shops, companies, business's are shutting down all over the place.
Does this fool read the papers? Texas is shutting down, covid19 is on the rise and we have no clue as to a cure. Trump has destroyed the country in the same manner he failed in business. Ignorance, incompetency and ineffectiveness.
But the problem is that Harris county is now taking action that is going to crush business again..not literally "an order" but an advisory to stay home, on top of Gov Abbott shutting down bars and limiting restaurants..all because of case numbers..
For Dallas County anyway: Can we point our resources towards the zip codes that need the help rather than just shutting it all down? No wonder none of these people run a business pic.twitter.com/MbDwJp6wy8
We were only supposed to shut down to flatten the curve so that the healthcare system wasn’t overwhelmed. Shutting down isn’t going to stop the virus, it’s just going to prolong it. The vulnerable should be in lockdown, the healthy with precautions should go about their business.
Gov. Ron DeFleckless of Florida, because of his incompetent governance during CHIVID-19, shutting shit down. Putting people out of business and out of work will definitely cost Trump Florida in November. Good job Ronnie. Asshole.
You better not let ONE protest gather without shutting it down immediately if you are forcing legitimate business to close. Not acceptable
@ PressSec Thanks two these two Democrat Doctors on Pence Covid-19 Team! Gov Abbot issued executive order shutting down small business that just opened! Not good for Republicans in 2020. These doctors helping Biden get in W H.
business' are shutting back down on their own. Show us what you are capable of don't just minimize and justify your actions which are few.
A journalist stated on TV that they’re shutting some stuff down in a few states because they have decided business comes second, life comes first. Try telling the hospitals who won’t give people a bed unless they have their corona test and a large pile of cash handy # COVID19India
Oh believe me they are! If you recall Las Vegas PD are the police department that made the news several times for shutting down little kids lemonade stands operating a business without a license.
Heart-wrenching anecdote of Argentina's Covid-19 lockdown economy on @ todonoticias just now. A store-owner in Liniers, Buenos Aires, is shutting shop after 22 years. He's behind on all business and personal payments. Will cut living costs and try to survive on a state pension..
Then we have Abbott in Texas and Ducey in Arizona. All three states are out of control and no mandatory mask policy and shutting down is never going to happen. On the good side the economy is going to pick up driven by the funeral business.
Needing a license to do business. That is what is repulsive. Sending in the TABC Gestapo Nazi’s to destroy businesses is a disgusting government abuse. Shutting down bars by taking their license, fining the owner. For what? Non-Compliance. Comply or die. Fascism
I would hardly call this a lockdown. @ GovAbbott continues to take baby steps backwards instead of shutting it all down to save lives. He's always been more devoted to business and his donors versus the people he's supposed to lead.
@ POTUS If V P Pence so far up those two Covid-19 Democrat Doctors butts! He is going to help Biden get in the W H. Killing GOP state supporters in Shutting business down again! Pence not very smart! After Covid-19 conference Look for fewer people at your rallies & mail votes.
Damn Stockwell business is shutting down
What's next , closing Banks ?after that going into people's homes and looking under their mattresses one day Zimbabwe is open for business , next day you're shutting down the business... solve the cause stop fighting the symptoms and these useless PR exercises pic.twitter.com/XI0wJkpS9y
TX has become a representation of the US Federal response. No statewide leadership, don't listen to experts and now business is in the precarious situation of shutting back down and causing more harm. Failed leadership and lack of reason in # TX21 has put us in this situation.
Then the governor just needs to shut up. Our business requires anyone coming in to wear a mask. If they don't or refuse they are refused admittance. We are simply trying to keep from shutting down again. It's a small and minor thing.
@ GOPLeader W H Covid-19 Democrat Medical Team Leaders are really helping Biden get in W H. By shutting business down in Republican States! Are these two reporting more cases in GOP states helping DEM in Republican states!
You musta missed where I said I wear the mask. But disagreeing with shutting down every business has nothing to do with politics like spongecuck suggested. It’s just simple analysis of stats.
A running list of Atlanta-area restaurants shutting down, testing employees for COVID-19, receiving a thorough cleaning, and reopening for business https://trib.al/ZBh98rD
Wear a mask indoors & distance: Texas and Florida shutting down economies (soon CA, AZ). I thought “do what you must do to keep the economy open” was the Republican rally cry—guess not! Sorry business owners (employees)! Every little bit helps! @ C_Stafford44 @ richardcostigan

If im worried about my extra 600? Dumbfuck how about you read the entire post. DO WE GO BACK TO WORK WITH NUMBERS RISING OR ARE WE SHUTTING DOWN AGAIN? WHAT DIRECTION DO WE GO IN. You do not know my or anyone elses situation. You know YOURS. Stay in your business.
@ tedcruz Covid-19 Team & doctors helping Democrats getting elected in 2020 by shutting business down with higher cases in Republican states! Trying to stop Rep going to polls in GOP Stares! Proof what happening!
@ POTUS Your Covid-19 is helping Democrats get elected in 2020 by scaring Americans away from polling places with their more cases being reported! Gov Abbott Executive order destroying business owners shutting small business down again!
Microsoft closing all its stores. Smart move. $ msft cleaning house. Shutting mixer and stores is smart business. But another sad sign for retail.

@ tedcruz Gov Abbott Signed an executive order shutting bars down! Gov Abbott keeps closing business he will cost Republicans votes in Texas! Abbott killing Americans livelihood & pissing liquor Industry off!
Because people maybe want to have a life? Maybe they want personal freedom? Maybe people who’ve worked their whole adult life to build a business want to keep it? We going to started shutting down every time a rise in the flu numbers happen?
@ GovAbbott you are really hurting your chances of being re-elected & hiring Republicans being re-elected in shutting business & business down again! You are destroying Americans livelihoods!
Haha, I didn't think you'd know the answer, just something for thought. It's a pretty big move though, at least it allows the bars to still have some business rather than just completely shutting them back down
The ironic thing is that YouTube is making a bad business model not just for its creative but for themselves. They make money when we make money, and if they're shutting down up-and-coming creators which they claim they want to try to help grow... (1/2)
We can only go by the best advice that is available. Thinking you are at risk at work, and being at risk are not necessarily the same. There are government health guidelines for reopening that if your business doesn’t follow can be grounds for shutting the business down.
Rona Picking Up & Business is shutting back down
This is not right, calls to @ GregAbbott_TX are what needs to be done keeping healthy people from work is wrong, shutting business is wrong.

All the CDC guildlines went out the window when the protestors and funeral crowd was in town. NOW, you show up! Were was that concern weeks ago!? Your back to shutting down business and putting people out of work.
These small business have been destroyed by the shutdown. No more shutdown or you will see civil demonstrations. What is next shutting down the beaches stop the madness.
It still doesn't change the chain reaction. People taking out of work, jobs shutting down, small business can't keep up with cost of decontamination. Loss of wages no compensation for some, even some who survived are being forced to retire early
Mixer is shutting down they have voiced to the mixer community that they are there to help! I do not see them turning around and banning a prominent mixer partner for doing one last stream on the platform that’s not a smart business move on their part!
Just shut the bars down. Damn it, all these half-measures are not working. We should be shutting things down and reimbursing these workers and business owners until the pandemic at least begins a decline. This whole country is so backwards and stupid.
Doubt $ MSFT can recreate a highly interactive and immersive digital storefront to replace the customer interactions and business of the retail store locations that it is shutting. Judging from its Q4 earning report it seems NKE couldn't do it.
I agree. The small business can't keep up with shutting down to decontaminate like the big corporations can. They're steadily having too either lay off the workers and replace them when they're sick. The cost for these cleaning are crazy they can't keep up with the cost.

@ GregAbbott_TX I love you as a governor sir, but shutting things down is going to kill small business again. A lot of us just got back on our feet. There’s gonna be an increase in cases because there’s an increase in testing. You can’t do this to all of us.
They can’t open fully because unemployment stopped. It’s a health concern that’s stopping business from opening fully. Houston is going backwards because they opened too quickly they are shutting down business today at 12:00. If businesses open fully Covid will spread faster
Most of the business which opened in unlock 1 .0 . Is almost shutting down as there is not initiative on # commercialrents and # commercialelectricity@cmo
He is not shutting them down, “The last thing we want to do as a state is go backwards and close down businesses. This temporary pause will help our state corral the spread until we can safely enter the next phase of opening our state for business."
@ GovAbbott this is my small family. We own a small brewery in Port Neches. Our business is our livelihood, it’s how we feed our family. You shutting us down is absurd!

saying that shutting every thing down is the worst on business owners is so ??? to me bc if everyone does from the fucking virus there will BE NO BUSINNESS ANY DAMN WAY
So the bar can be open but not do business lol good luck enforcing it. And good luck shutting the country back down after businesses refuse to stop doing business. Ppl need to make a living they wont starve to death over fear of a virus.
The biggest problem is that this virus is shoved in our face everyday 24/7 all while putting massive amounts of businesses out of business and making the bread line grow. I fear for the president this is setting. Shutting down for the flu now too?
With half the country shutting back down i’d like to remind everyone my DM’s are an essential business and will continue to operate under normal circumstances

From shutting down @ WatchMixer and closing the retail Microsoft Store, I think @ Microsoft spent too much money on their business ideas.
Truthfully, it’s time to consider shutting down again but @ GovRonDeSantis is too concerned about big business to protect the people of our state.
Texas had a slight increase in cases in five Democratic cities. Shutting down bars in the whole state is absurd.
Republicans are good for business, which is why they reopened their states as fast as possible, which is why the virus is now spreading like wildfire there, which is why they’re now shutting down all businesses again.

I'll remind you that trump got called a racist for shutting down travel from china before it was recommended. Also Pelosi was saying everything was business as usual in mid to late march and that no one needs masks. This was a complete flop for both sides
Next week, the CARES act ends the $600 unemployment boost, and foreclosure limitations also end in many places on the 1st, so lots of people are going to start picking food or rent. At the same time, most states will be shutting down business again, increasing unemployment.

Deciding to start a business after finding out the company i was working for was shutting down. I could have just found another job. Started a business instead.
That’s bs. Just cos a customer gets cv, doesnt mean it’s picked it up from a pub, you can catch it anywhere. Cleaning premises is all that’s required, shutting it for 2 weeks achieves nothing but damages business. There’s no common sense to this policy if not applied to all.
"Ratings and money" is one thing for WWE. But as Bryan Alvarez has already stated, if AEW had stopped their shows, they would be out of business. It isn't anywhere near a logical decision. Completely shutting down a company vs finding safe ways to perform? Think about it.
I hope so! I know some of the locations were shutting down prior to the virus, too. I feel so bad for business owners right now...especially small business owners! It’s such a volatile time for many.
@ MichaelsStores By shutting down your wholesale price stores... you ruin small cottage business. Why? Greed & the bottom line. Well, I've checked out your "new" prices & you've LOST a customer. I WILL NOT buy from you. Shame on you.

Yes. I have a TG5, it's a great camera for what I want it for. taking snaps when riding my bike. I think it's "selling off" rather than shutting shop and until they sell it, business as usual.

There is no way for Iowa's business and economy to recover until the pandemic is under control, and it is not going to be under control until some real measures are taken, including requiring mask use in public, more testing with contact tracing and shutting down high-risk....

Shutting business down until July 31 at the earliest. No reason to risk being shutdown for longer. These rules will ease up sooner or later.

Money talks. The Deep State can’t prop up every business. In the past, some were supported by government money, but I strongly suspect, PDJT is shutting that down without much fanfare.
Hubby says that's not enforceable, meaning not fining or shutting them down the business if they refuse. The card might be real he says, but it has no power. I never saw anything like that before so I had to ask.

On the difference between GDP and consumption: Singapore, Luxembourg, and Norway have GDP quirks that overstate their consumption levels, which makes healthcare seem disproportionately cheap relative to GDP, while the US has quirks going to the opposite direction.
I assumed they had given up on this. I guess they are hoping for a trickle of damaging soundbites from now until November, but no one will care with GDP at -10% and people dying.
We spend 14% of GDP through public contracting, that money has to create jobs & deliver services going forwards. Knowing if a business has been able to sustain / create jobs is a good indicator of its capacity for growth.
Essentially the people that live in DC have no representation in Congress or state level government. There's a significant population and a GDP bigger than some states so its easier to keep it its own separate thing but they also need representation.
Over 124,000 Americans have died. Over a million Americans are infected. - 5% GDP. Almost 30 million Americans have lost their employment. Food lines are forming as far as the eye can see. Rents are due. Americans are suffering. Trump's priority is protecting statues? # Sad
Percent of consumed by healthcare is largely a function of the total consumption, which GDP is relatively close to as a proxy. When we think about why the U.S. healthcare system seems bad, it's that who consumes the healthcare on what is less useful.

This is going to blow your mind but single payer nationalised healthcare would SAVE Americans a lot of money. No other developed nation spends as much of their GDP on Healthcare and you still have bad healthcare outcomes. The insurance companies and big pharma are ripping you off

A study by the World Bank found that countries whose debt-to-GDP ratios exceeds 77% for prolonged periods, experience significant slowdowns in economic growth. Pointedly: every percentage point of debt above this level costs countries 1.7% in economic growth.
676k single family homes sold in May. We are talking millions out of work that will slow spending when stimulus runs out (unless there is more provided or they all go back to work). Consumer spending is 70% of GDP.

UP has been doubling its GDP per capita every 6/7 years. Its still so low if it's repeated from here on say in 2027, it will then still be behind where KA, MH are today. Underscores that if northern states gallop ahead on GDP, the surge for national stats is enormous.
The population of Istanbul is significantly higher including the immigrant population and the metro region which contributes to its GDP. The population of the Balkan is lower, the census numbers are out of date, Albania is deserted. Most people work abroad half of the year.

san low debt doesn't mean much (nor does debt to GDP ratio, but it's still a better metric). Incurring debt is perhaps the only way under current global financial system to fund critical infrastructure projects like highways, dams, railway that fuel economic growth
Trump ignored repeated warnings about the pandemic. He can't even set a simple example of wearing a mask. USA is doing far worse than any other country. Excuses don't cut it. <5%> GDP Trump borrowed a lot of money-HUGE deficits-to continue the yearly growth inherited from Obama.
I’m guessing you don’t actually know what a recession or depression is. I’m also pretty certain you don’t understand the meaning of GDP. But the GDP contracted 5.4% last quarter. Go ask a grown-up how bad that is, then get back to me.
Yep GDP and is and always has been an extremely poor yardstick of progress... During WW2 as millions died in war and cities were firebombed GDP went on a tear

"As a percentage of GDP" Explain why that matters; explain why you were so convinced that it was falling in absolute terms when it wasn't. Your brain is in the grip of such a powerful delusion that you immediately shift your thoughts when your premises are disproven.

It also has a higher gdp/capita than any country that isn’t literally drowning in oil, but 1) that’s in large part due to their sound policies such as forgoing high taxes in favor of mandatory savings and 2) even on a per capita basis it’s still quite cheap comparatively
