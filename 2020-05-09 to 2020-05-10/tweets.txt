You are put to lunch if that’s what you think. Using social distancing, lockdowns for a Period to get the curve flattened then followed by everyone using precautions (masks, distancing), testing and contact tracing to isolate those infected will enable economy recovery.

Retired folks with a high chance of dying don’t care for the # fuckit approach to containing # Covid_19 with economy opening
For this pandemic, I have realized that there are no completely relevant experts. There are infectious disease experts that can hypothesize how the disease is likely to spread and to harm us. There are economic experts but an economy has never been shut down like this.
And it's a 50/50 chance we'll have to Take! American's have to begin working, the Economy will keep the CDC alive. Give the Report to Nancy to tear up! We are ending poverty! @ realDonaldTrump

As many times as I try not to think it, you never fail to act like an idiot. Nice they you had access to health care but many of the workers that will get the economy going do not. They will simply be statistics of corona deaths.
Conservatives be like “when the economy opens back up only buy products that are MADE IN THE USA!!” and then exclusively decorate their homes in hobby lobby decor
Fixed the trashed Republican economy so Trump could break it again.
Against all odds? He had both houses on his side for two years and accomplished dick, other than riding Obama’s economy like it was Stormy Daniels.
You’re not an Economist. DumberThanaLightBulb Donnie was ruining the Economy long before the virus.

That’s sad. It doesn’t matter though, as the economy is trashed no matter what we do. Your economy isn’t going to do very well if thousands of people are dying every day. So we can trash the economy and minimize death or trash it with thousands dying.

Let’s just stay in lockdown until 2030. No existing economy to worry about, most people have starved to death so no one’s arguing and certainly no one’s dying from the Kung Flu.
“flatten the curve” that was some kind of BS. They want to control everyone. They love the control & they got their wish, tanked the economy under Trump. It still feels like a bad dream. Never thought they would lock folks up & throw people in jail who WANT to go to work! NUTS
What's the point then? He Is saying that the quarantine should be stopped... because "the economy is being hit hard and the disease is affecting more poor than wealthy people?" What I'm missing here?
Your logic is simply incomprehensible. I don't think you understand how the US economy works. We are a consumer driven economy. If we (consumers) don't have the funds, we can't buy things. If we don't buy things, the economy dips further into a recession and then a depression.

It’s time to get economy back open. We need to weigh permanent destruction of the economy Vs. deaths. The virus is serious but loss jobs, hunger, suicide, drug-alcohol addiction, is as deadly. One professional said deaths in this area will be at least 75K. Media=doom&gloom!

Hey @ realDonaldTrump when everyone’s mortgages become due very soon, some 3 months in full, there’s going to be real economic impact. Your election hinges on how the citizens are affected by the economy.
Trump is counting on his red hat “patriots” to flaunt medical advice as gov overreach to “stimulate “ the economy. Meanwhile, case & death counts are increasing. I’m not going out anywhere I don’t need to go, especially to restaurants.
when looking at the size of our country 77k death is insignificant. 7700 people die every day in america from all causes. 77k spread across 3 or 4 months isnt reason to kill the economy
How about opening the economy and we all go back to work? I think that would work a little better than your plan.

When the Prime Minister suggests ‘taking it on the chin’, shakes hands with literal patients and delays lockdown for the sake of the economy, I don’t think exploring other ‘potential explanations’ is really necessary. Anything but criticism for the gov. is defence in my eyes.

No need to, President Trump wants to open up the entire economy already, safely so, as Elon suggested with Tesla’s factories. He is suing the county, as he should, and he did invite others to sue (shareholders). If he were concerned only about himself, he’d be sleeping on a beach

Life begins at conception, and ends when it’s detrimental to the economy.
You are a fool. The unemployment isn't due to wrong or bad economic policy. The economy was paused to mitigate the spread of the virus. Every country's economy is down now. It is global. It is sad that there are a lot of foolish people in the US.
Yep, unemployment payment rate has been temporarily doubled here, and most of that will be going back into the economy and paying bills, but govt was reluctant to do it to begin with, because the number of unemployed doubled virtually overnight

Wouldn't that be a benefit of having a downward trending unemployment rate before getting sworn in? Who could mess that up
what do you expect when you shut down a country, Now only democrat states are seeing high unemployment and republican states the people are back at work. The people blame the democrats for the states shut down not the president who will see a landslide in Nov you lost

Yeah the COVID situation is dicey with how backed up unemployment is. I’m not sure if anyone has a good solution to encompass everyone affected or if there even is one that’s possible.
FJG is a federal jobs guarantee. The feds fund it. Local govt, ideally direct-democratically, decides what's important that the private sector isn't doing and offers jobs in those things, paid by the feds, at a living wage. No mandate to work, but zero INVOLUNTARY unemployment.

What if the worker earns 2400$ and unemployment insurance is 70%? And the JG jobs pay at least 2400$
Perhaps. But people need to be able to feed their families in the long run and exponential unemployment does not bode well for local health and well being beyond this virus.
@ realDonaldTrump so the state of Missouri stopped giving out the $600 per week for those self employed that can not go back to work yet this week I was given $75 in unemployment to support my household on. My county still has us closed down.

I’m guessing it means getting back paid from unemployment but I’ve gotten money for all the time I’ve been off so I’m confused
And nearly everyone has complied with social distancing - it's failed because we have such an incompetent govt that failed badly on PPE and is now willing to oversee disastrous economic damage and record unemployment levels. And they said herd immunity would be armageddon
Universal Basic Income > deduct cost of health insurance > all artists who rely on tour money get health coverage and "unemployment" benefits.
Stop the lies dude, furloughed people are going to make same as their take home pay through unemployment benefits (according to official Tesla PR; see attached, 3rd bullet point) You care about stock price not workers, admit it pic.twitter.com/zJKIt0YUz5
It's clear you have never owned a business so you really don't know what you are talking about. Without bailout money unemployment would currently be over 70% but your hatred for those you perceive have more than you blinds you to this fact.
All the useful idiots that could care less if Musk leaves the state. Considering CA is $54B in the hole and has massive unemployment, every company that leaves are jobs that won't return to CA and lead to a greater depression.
Corporations in america dont give a nickel about the common people. Look at the stock market vs unemployment rate right now in america. The people can moan and complain, can line up for food all they wany... While normal americans get a paltry 1,200... 1% are getting 1m +each.
what's this i heard on cnn? you can get unemployment benefits even if you were coerced to return to work?
Hi everyone I know this doesnt apply to anyone but I had applied in mid march and didn’t receive my unemployment until last week. Today I received an email identifying me as someone w missing weekly certifications. I know how frustrating this can be bc I too was waiting for while
I would actually prefer it if my job would just fire me instead of paying the shitty amount of money they’ve been. Schools don’t pay shit and I’d be better off getting unemployment
"Get 'em out!... No, wait, bring 'em back!" 7.9% unemployment rate. Brexiteers wanted all those minimum wage jobs for themselves. Oh the irony!

Germany started testing in Mid January. Germany prepared. Germany's unemployment went from 5 to 5.8% Germany is reopening safely right now. This could have been America if America had a leader that had a clue.
This is from the Department of Labor showing that unemployment started going down down in 2009 and continued Trump just followed along. Google it or is DOL lying? pic.twitter.com/1spyKa2vAm
You are a fool. The unemployment isn't due to wrong or bad economic policy. The economy was paused to mitigate the spread of the virus. Every country's economy is down now. It is global. It is sad that there are a lot of foolish people in the US.
Yep, unemployment payment rate has been temporarily doubled here, and most of that will be going back into the economy and paying bills, but govt was reluctant to do it to begin with, because the number of unemployed doubled virtually overnight
bitches be going on online shopping sprees with unemployment money. Set better standards!
They’re not mutually exclusive, but as your previous tweeter pointed out, it requires nuanced thinking, and creative thinking like that doesn’t seem so easily reached across the aisles today. The facts of the matter demonstrate that longterm unemployment as deadly as # COVID19 .

they all ignored the 14 days of decreasing numbers, the focus isn't the health of the citizens it's presenting trump with low unemployment numbers in those states, get those hrly workers back out there, that $600 really irritated salary workers
Unemployment affects safety and health too. Ask the millions that are out of work and their families.

The collateral damage is going to be MUCH WORSE. People lost their livelihoods, their businesses, some people in this state haven't received unemployment. Wtf is wrong with everyone? The goal wasn't to get rid of the disease, it was to slow the spread so hospitals don't get full

It’s what the Germans do. Check their unemployment numbers. And if we don’t, check again every six months.
Is waiting 6 weeks for unemployment to give me anything enough for me to jump headfirst into corrosive acid?
All well and good but I still should not have to wait 7 weeks (filed 3/22) for unemployment. Claim it still pending with no way in the world to contact them. ( no way that they have answered) I know they are swamped but 7 weeks?
Polls, ads glorifying the new normal and unemployment checks are validating the fear imposed by the media and empowering group think. But if you look around, many people are moving on, ignoring the restrictions and living life. It’s happening.

Yes, this is what we are not realizing. There are a lot more jobs loss that we are not accounting for. How about all of the illegals who clean homes, work in restaurants, and do construction? Those numbers are not accounted in the analysis of unemployment.
The U.S. unemployment rate soared to 14.7% in April — the highest level since the Great Depression. The Labor Department says 20.5 million jobs were lost last month, wiping out most of the gains of the past decade. https://trib.al/bnmPpkz

I’m making more money from unemployment than I’ve made in years and I don’t have to go to work at a job that demeans me. I can use my time (mostly) how I want. I miss my friends and seeing music but I’m able to see a new and better of way of living.
So the country is to continually sit at home receiving unemployment benefits?? Are you serious??
Stop trying to take any blame away from our stable genius’s leadership. He fired the response team. Downplayed the virus. Stock market crash. Worst unemployment since 1920. And yet he still lies to the herd and they believe it. You believe it.
Anything anyone can do about key2benefits not answering their phone? I’ve held on the phone for 7 hours today alone and yesterday about the same. Unemployment went through I have my card but it’s frozen for some reason so I have no money. @ NYGovCuomo anyone anyone at all!? No $
Everyone eats with unemployment money
So lets try to understand fake news MSNBC. The Democrats pushed the President to close all the busineses in the country because they thought closed business would help lower the unemployment rate? Now its the blue states that remain closed and thats going to help unemployment?
That or they’re happy sitting home collecting the unemployment checks instead. My wife does payroll for a retail chain & lots are making more from big gov than working & using it as an incentive to not come back now that they’re reopening forcing some stores to remain closed
You’re naive, Brendan, simple as that. Let’s just acknowledge that unemployment is tied to the pandemic. The US response to the pandemic is deeply flawed when compared to other countries.
Unemployment leads to a higher rate of suicide, but so can the loneliness of social distancing.
Perhaps the government shouldn’t have shut down all the jobs....unemployment is what happens when you aren’t allowed to go to work. Open businesses and watch the unemployment numbers drop. Stop ranting.
i may act like im fine but in reality im still waiting for my unemployment to come in so i can spend it on a switch
Trust me my resume is splendid. Nearly 10 million people have filed for Unemployment therefor it will take them a long time to get back to certain people. If I was so dumb , I would have no savings and unable to feed myself or pay bills for the last 49 days
When the unemployment runs dry and people are still not working we will see how this all plays out. I have a plan that will work. And no I'm not interested in politics.
Governor. Don't forget the. Relsove,unemployment, problem. Get those payment. Out already been applying since March nothing yet ok.
Mad as fuck. Got home from work, house is trashed. Animals still in their houses (they're supposed to be let out in the morning). 4 people sitting on their ass all day collecting unemployment, and the one actually working has to do all the chores too.
NY extended to June 6th well NYC might be ... but what about rest of the state with small towns, counties and people just want to work? Some being in unemployment purgatory for 30+ gays
True. It’s hard to imagine long distance travellers going anywhere near Europe this year. With so much unemployment, I think most people aren’t in that frame of mind.
Other tragedies are certainly in play, but I think it's woven together. If you are affected, I'm sorry. Final thought. Germany is projected to have a 3.9% unemployment rate this year. Australia had 20 new cases yesterday. We could be doing better for everyone. Peace & health.

Strawman argument. We are talking about how poorly Prez.Clorox has handled the pandemic. On complete lockdown and weve got 1.5 MM cases, 80K deaths and 20% unemployment in 8 weeks. Biden was VP during two pandemics, and he's not anti-science, so this wouldnt have happened.

Thank you, exactly! 36 weeks during a pandemic just isn’t long enough for unemployment insurance payments, especially with this economy vs the high unemployment rate. We need # UBI, and an extended period for unemployment, until this pandemic is over.

LIFO rule is why black unemployment was ever higher than white unemployment. You know the cause. As economy kept expanding black folks were hired, now sadly 1st let go. Just think about black soldiers fr wars that couldn’t get house loans. That wealth loss can’t be made up.

I wonder the percentage of those polled who are making more on unemployment (and/or are UBI advocates) than they would working.
Thats gonna raise the unemployment percentage by about 1% which doesn't sound crazy but in the big picture, unemployment has been going down by about .4% each year. A shock like this to the economy is going to scare the shit out of everyone. (3/?)

You do realize, some folks are getting paid more collecting unemployment, than they would...if they were actually working. And its mostly the lower income bracket, that's getting this benefit.
They are also the ones getting the extra $600 per week with their unemployment checks. They are not scared ... they just don’t want to go back to work making less money.

Lol that’s a broken scale argument. More white people are shot only because they’re the majority. The 60+%. They have more wrecks, get pulled over more, more are on unemployment, federal assistance, etc. But I’m terms of being a danger, they’re less likely to get shot. Us more
I actually don’t understand why the effects of 8 weeks of shutdown and 20M+ people out of work hasn’t been greater in most markets. Is it just a combination of unemployment benefits + stimulus + fed acting as a buyer of last resort + it just hasn’t been long enough?
We had 3.5% unemployment. I think last time most people were brought along !
And for that unemployment question quite simple: they were unemployed because of the virus. Not because of the shutdown order. Once the Spanish flu ended the roaring 20’s followed. Or do you think demand will return? This isn’t a hoax for government control, lmao

You do know he brought unemployment down from 10% to 5%. Trump gets praised for bringing it down to 3 something, a difference of 2 percent. But a difference of 5 percent is nothing and obviously a bad thing to have done for the country.

So you want to lock us down more to stop the spread? Guess what.. unemployment goes even higher. Moronic
High unemployment rates make it hard for people to spare $60, and if they dropped it even to $40, they could reach a much much broader audience in all the people who don’t normally watch mma and are staying home
Unemployment is tipped to hit 10% in July. A report last week showed there would be nine affordable rental listings for a jobseeker if the payment is halved to $280pw. https://twitter.com/SkyNewsAust/status/1259258808318095360 …

Government relief checks and unemployment. Makes me not even wanna go back to work fr
It's all about forcing businesses to reopen, taking away their eligibility for any assistance. Forcing them to bring back employees and getting them off unemployment. If business closes because it can't sustain, they'll blame the initial shutdown as the cause.
My suggestion is that they provide more money to ppl who actually need it not checks to everyone. Ppl on unemployment made more than many still working. Government has no idea what they are doing. Businesses can open if they follow social distancing. Herd immunity isnt guaranteed
Unemployment insurance boost is tiny next to tax cuts for the rich, this week in the war on workers https://bit.ly/2Ll1Fy5

Ah yes during the worst global recession ever with staggering levels of unemployment, I'm sure things will look rosy.

5 - Employers would save mountains of cash not having to pay out to have over priced insurance benifits. 6 - you could hire and fire people quicker and not have to pay out big severance packages. (Heck universal basic income would mean no unemployment costs)
The right really are correct, in thinking of unemployment as a disease walking to town, passing peeps living rough, faces in glue bags even in the town square Oddly, my time and place, it was Maggie T. that caused it. Now back to extreme right. Again. Ideologies can be toxic.

Perhaps biggest red flag was a Federal Reserve report last year that warned that nearly 40% of Americans couldn’t come up w/ $400 for an emergency. Some analysts found it hard to believe that this was the case at a time when the nation’s unemployment rate was under 4 percent.

Unfortunately with 15% unemployment” and growing that might not be possible.
And Ohio is one of the states that has cases increasing. Also, has a website where employers can report employees-who don’t want to come back to work because they are afraid of getting sick-so they can’t get unemployment benefits.
Have you been able to apply for unemployment?
Soon passing 100.000+++ dead Americans. An economy in ruins. Unemployment at levels not seen since the great depression. The US on the brink of civil war. And Putin's little minion, aka agent Orange turd, is talking about "greatness" in all caps. # TrumpDepression
Strategies clear if you look at what happens when forcing people into poverty isn't enough people. People who are afraid to return because it's not safe for being told their unemployment benefits will be cut.

they redid the entire unemployment page, it works now without that error
Marcos Rubio explained that the law cares for 2.2 trillion $ equivalent to 2 months of the national budget. As it is possible that in the first month unemployment was 22% and today it is around 32%. Where did the money go for the corp and many people have not received anything.
Never stopped working. Most successful state in what regard? Unemployment claims? When people's rent relief expires how will they pay it? How many will die non covid who couldn't get care? Education, non-existant. Kids in poverty, food banks swamped, on and on. Successful? Hardly

Democrat controlled states are also delaying unemployment benefits to people desperately in need of money for food and bills. This is a deliberate attempt to inflict as much pain as possible on families across America and then turn around to lay the blame on @ realDonaldTrump
You mean an economy in freefall, the highest unemployment rate since the great depression, and 78,000 dead Americans.

Under capitalism it will. Unemployment is another word for excess of labor. There should be no excess of labor when there is poverty. When wealth is decided by who had the money our society stops taking care of eachother.

Trump didn't start doing anything about the virus until the stock market went down. He only cares about the 1% in America. If some of his supporters would drop him things would be a lot better.
1/2. Claude is also brainwashed into believing the stock market is a predictor. Who tells you that? People who make money if you invest in the market. Consider this, stocks are up this week, down last week, up next week. What does that mean for the economy in 6-12 months?

Try to listen. I don't blame Trump for the virus. I blame him for calling it a hoax, misleading the public on test, worrying about his stock market over human life. Promoting unproven drugs.Showing absolutely no compassion Continually undermining facts. Not acting as a president
He’s saying anyone with these conditions can get F’d. Their blood will fuel the stock market. “Becuz we gotta reopen”
The way to reopen the economy that Trump doesn’t want the public to see. He doesn’t care if your child dies. He cares how the stock market looks CDC official leaks their re-opening plans after Trump team swears they'd "never see light of day" https://occupydemocrats.com/2020/05/08/cdc-official-leaks-their-re-opening-plans-after-trump-team-swears-theyd-never-see-light-of-day/ …
Testing and tracking is the best way. Instead of more fumbling Trump is just pleasing the stock market by reopening without a solid plan. It’s sure to backfire. Even if you open up more than 60 % of the population will not come pouring in so it’s still an anemic economy

So much new money rushing into the market from people who avoided the stock market for years. Brokerage houses everywhere are recording record sign ups. Advice I am giving to people that ask me is to invest a 3rd and then be patient and wait before investing the rest.
And most of them consider themselves business people??? U couldn’t figure out how to live and grow ur business off of a billion dollars??? What ru spending the excess money on u can’t leave ur house rn and the stock market is doing badly!!!!!
You're missing the point. We're not learning to live with covid by shutting down all businesses in L4, most in L3 except essential services. Rather than blindly accepting the decisions like in business & personal life we should be asking can we do better? The answer is Yes we can
Lost the jobs because the government insisted ALL businesses shut down. We had similar crisis in 1969 w similar results without shutting down business. All a plan to try to turn USA into Venezuela. Make everyone dependant on government handouts and then control us

The shutting down (from trumps perspective) was to create an economic crisis to justify a money grab for the rich Poor and middle class got pennies. The rich got trillions, and trump is angling for more
On the line? I would absolutely do that. You think the federal govt is going to save us? They never have and never will. That’s why that Dallas Salon business opened. Enough is enough. This was not handled correctly. Shutting all these businesses created more harm
I think the state police needs to be disbanded. A Governor shouldn't have a Gestapo at her beckon callThe Chief of the state police is worse than the Governor because if he don't have a problem with shutting down a place of business then he won't have a problem shooting Citizens

Right. Because there's an objective standard for what is and isn't essential. The fact that you don't seem to have an issue with the government arbitrarily declaring a business non essential and shutting it down is telling.
Shutting business to stop corona is not a communism, it is socialism. More over its for humanity. If we survive we can make a better world.

Social distancing, works, masks work, washing your hands with soap and using sanitizer works. Shutting every business without giving them a chance to implement those steps will result in much larger cost of life than ones from pandemic.
31,500 people died yes... however, they don’t need a positive test to write the cause of death as corona virus. The numbers are being fabricated to fit their narrative. Shutting small business’s is bad for the economy.

There is a difference between shutting down the country short-term, and "indefinitely" like the original poster is claiming. We currently have more than twice the number of Covid19 deaths than any other country which is embarrassing That's unfortunate about your business. Really
But that’s not treating them equally though. That’s giving them special needs by ruining our economy, making people lose their livelihood and ruining their lives, shutting business forever, increasing the number of people with depression, domestic violence to save a useless group
Ya because everything is shut down no one is working business are shutting down. If we open now yes will lose lives ofc we will which is a bad thing. But we can save people going through poverty though there entire lives.
I have a question almost embarrassed to ask but if the corona virus brings us back to shutting down and even at 25 percent and big business folds and money runs out how is it the stock market isn’t tanking like it did after 911? Or am I jumping ahead and thinking too much?

It is imperative that we open up the economy and stop all the useless restrictions. This virus can be controlled without shutting down business. The at risk people can be self quarantined, the rest can get back to a normal life. This is not a real pandemic like the 1918 flu was.

I agree, greater protection is certainly needed in care homes but unfortunately the reality of that is entirely different and the business owners need to be held accountable. My sister’s work has been hit hard during this pandemic and simply shutting them off isn’t an option.
good read. what i fail to understand at this point though is how does shutting down the biggest media company in the Philippines help Duterte's regime? especially now. will he not be benefited by the multiplier effect of any business enterprise?
Secondly, the logic of caretaker govt – with limited powers, is inconsistent with logic of emergencies, which necessitate a govt with full, even exceptional powers (such as shutting your business, telling you to pray at home) during n in the immediate aftermath of the emergency.
Is the IRS in the US currently shutting down business for foreigners (issuing EIN) ?? I understand that foreigners cannot apply online. So I applied by fax. Am I wrong? I also sended an e-mail about the process via e-mail, but could not receive an answer.
I don’t get it. The shutdowns haven’t had a huge impact on the economy? Yes the pandemic itself also has had an impact (maybe even a bigger one) but to say that shutting down all business had ZERO impact seems absurd. Millions of people would spend more if businesses were open.

Idk who needs to hear this but a reminder that net worth ≠ liquid cash. If you are one of the people calling out Gail Miller for furloughing employees while having a 1.7B net worth consider shutting up or maybe just thinking logically for a few minutes about LHM business ops
I've admired you for yrs. I only care about my lil girl not getting sick. I can handle my business shutting down, saying goodbye to my 830 credit score and doing without but what brings me to my knees is children suffering. ALL med attn needs to be focused towards our kids. Help
No shit. That's why you quarantine & return to work when you can. Better than shutting down completely and having no job to come back to b/c the business went belly up. Businesses don't just go into an infinte holding pattern when they close down. They eventually close for good.

Do people think that opening up the economy is just going to stop the virus. The economy should be able to survive this kind of thing, shutting down business is something that is required for this to pass, we should have been prepared. And those that want to open the country-
Mike Huckabee had a great suggestion on Laura Ingram tonight. No one in authority can take any salary until all the people they put on unemployment by shutting down the economy. As he said, business would be back up and running quickly.
No, there needs to be adjustments but we cannot keep on with shutting business down. CBS had a report that there could be around 75,000 deaths caused by suicide, despair, etc due to lost jobs, finances, homes. Do those deaths not count as highly?
Well...one way to end the fallout; Open up for business. Shutting down to protect 1% of the sickly population does not make sense. Yes. I know, those are lives. Yes. Now open it up. # Coronavirus
Lockdowns are good to give the experts ample time to come up w/ a vaccine but the prolonged shutting down of business creates a big problem not only among employers but most importantly among regular workers.

Our family is crushed that @ souplantation is shutting down. We ate there sometimes once a week because it was way healthier and fresher than fast food, and our three kids loved the variety. Our prayers to the families impacted by the closure of a great business
Government shutting down all this other shit and reopening business not realizing if you shut down summer camps, etc... it raises the price and cost of daycare for kids, which isn't necessarily safe or sanitary, which then means parents will need to be home and not work.
Many will. How is that good for businesses? All that means is they’ll be paying to keep the utilities on but not earning enough to cover it. Re-open when it’s safe for everyone to do business, or else risk shutting right back down again when cases get out of control.

A mid to long term 10% decline in GDP would be hugely deflationary .
Lowest unemployment for every demographic in US history. Highest workforce participation in history. Consistently strong GDP growth. Record low inflation. Obama growth rates reflect recovery from 2008 crisis & were outsized briefly, then slowed dramatically. Whats not to like?

I don’t believe the reported numbers, but I believe in electricity consumption as proxy of GDP growth.

Trump's record in office (5/9/20) 1. 30 million jobs lost 2. Highest unemployment since 1930s 3. 1.4 mil cases due to his inaction 4. 80,000 deaths (78k by Trump) 5. Less than 3% tested 6. Over 19,000 lies 7. Biggest GDP drop since 2009 A job well done? # resist # LiarInChief
We've got a ~100 trillion dollars global GDP, that's way more than enough to vaccinate everyone a thousand times. Problem is, if you lose a sizable amount of your braintrust and caregivers, it's going to be harder to return to $100T.
20,000 out of 80,000 is 50%? Math is hard. And yes, NYC is 1/3 of the population centers. You’re whining because you know without the innovation, hard work and GDP of NYC, there is no economy. pic.twitter.com/HEUeFEe2HY
Yeah I agree actually. You cant just tax the rich more, they will always use their resources to make sure they pay a lower proportion of their income than the most people. I would do the same thing if I was them. I prefer programs that can pay for themselves through GDP growth
In his $4B the Treasurer is including both production and consumption. In measuring GDP, economists use either consumption or production. Josh is double counting.

I meant Shock therapy (albeit, shock doctrine does apply too) This is especially true if you look at their fleeing populations & falling fertility rate, but even true if you assume low GDP per capita growth rates from 1970-1990 (which were slow). It's a failure in economic terms!
Man, you have too much energy for this stuff. My point was supposed to be a simple one. Stocks and GDP? Ignore them then. But % of world pop living in absolute poverty is a good measure. The current system is the worst system ever apart from all the others. We SHOULD reform it.

The scale of economic impact of a 6 month lockdown (if needed) is no worse than the reduction in GDP growth under LNP since 2013. This muck-lather of sweat that Frydenburg & Morrison get themselves in over $4B/week is just a political ploy playing to the capitalist growth fetish.

The US getting hit with a double-whammy on the manufacturing value-added metric: -Balance of trade -Large service/resources share Per capita manufacturing is questionable inclusion, but having % of GDP is borderline-ridiculous - hits Japan, UK, Norway. Pretty questionable metric.
The S&P 500 represents about 80% of the market cap of all public companies traded in the US. It's an excellent proxy for the broader economy, especially since, on average, the 500 largest companies have saturated their markets, hence depend more on GDP growth for earnings growth
2021 budget deficit will probably be biggest in our history... closer to 3% of our GDP...
this seems like a terrible metric measuring by billion dollars of GDP instead of per capita penalizes countries who have higher GDP per capita-often as a result of innovation to some extent you’re measuring innovation controlled for productivity boosting innovations
Entirely possible that the electorate might want a change of management after next quarter’s -70% GDP growth.
Mostly agree I just think giving jobs to other countries hurts the working class here and our over all gdp. Got to be a way to compromise in this situation. Right now we are flipping the bill in more ways than one.

Right. So these are shares of each country’s GDP in world GDP. As they change, as in China’s case, from 3% to 16%, so will the trade volume, while controlling for distance. Still doesn’t make distance irrelevant. And China is an exception rather than the rule.

What's interesting to note up there is that health care expenditure per capita is correlated to every metric. GDP is only correlated to three, but is significantly correlated to those three. These relationships are positive as well.

I heard on NPR the term “decoupling” to describe the Market’s rise and stability in spite of the fact GDP fell by 4.8% and about 15% of people are unemployed. OK, I don’t believe in irrational exuberance; shouldn’t the SEC get involved to determine why the Market isn’t reacting?
Meanwhile they foot the bill for states in the South. It's hilarious that you don't think you need the financial sector when our currency isn't based on a crop or commodity. They go down and we go down. 9 out of top 11 states for GDP are "Blue States". Maybe just be American?

But we are supposed to subsidize this president failed tax breaks and tariff war. How much has been added to the national debt because his projection of GDP would go up because of tax breaks and it didn’t. how much was given to farmers because of his tariff war.
How so? Denmark makes nearly the same GDP per capita as the US. They've got Maersk, one of the world's largest shipping companies, tons of other Pharma companies. They seem to manage fine
Yeah that all makes sense and I agree with those you cite that GDP is a rather poor metric for overall welfare (inequality + diminishing marginal value of $). However this is only an argument for diminished importance of the economy, not total unimportance.
I think the bad faith goes in two directions on this subject. Reactionaries are always just wrong about everything, but FDR apologists consistently ignore that GDP expanded *only* to the degree to which gold was devalued in the $20 to $35 move until Lend-Lease spending in '39.
Thanks for the link. I was referring to GDP growth, but using your measure these were the GDP per capita growths between 2008 and 2014. USA -5% Australia +26% UK +31% NZ +42%
We aren’t talking about GDP gain. They have silicon value and SF, of course Cali GDP grew last year. Both net business exits and population. Even including immigration, Cali population growth is flat lining.
GDP per capita in Scotland was about half that in England at the time of the union. It is now about the same. That suggests Scotland has done twice as well as England out of the union.

Idk if I’d say ‘save the economy’ is dogwhistle for ‘save the wealthy’ — rather, I just think other leftists probably see less connection between conventional economic measures & overall welfare. I certainly don’t think more GDP straightforwardly translates to ‘more welfare’.

Yep, there are winners and losers. Highly correlated, of course, with (Total GDP)/Population. As the developing world increases GDP per capita, so will their educational participation rates. It is hardly a matter of priority when many countries must focus on needs, not wants.

The stats on the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, our cost/price & consumer/price indexes as well as the GDP show that it was Obama's admin that took us from a recession to nearly where we are today. Trump only deserves credit for continuing the direction in which we were going.
GDP is contributed mostly by hardworking people like MUSK... not by people on welfare and unemployment
Yes without demonetisation & flawed gst GDP would have been between 8to10%. The economy would have absorbed this impact to a great extent.
Above a certain level of GDP there is no correlation between growth and measures of human well being such as education and life expectancy. Example used is Portugal which has 66% gdp per capita of US but higher measures of wellbeing. Talks about the scientific consensus.
Where’s the rainy day fund. ????? Thought we were the best in G7 financially??? Low debt to GDP. ?!! Lies lies lies Yes we believe it all !!! Idiots.
This is what HMG is thinking of doing: 12 FULL weeks of lockdown. BofE estimates every week of lockdown costs 0.67% of GDP on annual basis. If we don't kick a fuss these people will totally destroy the economy and our civil liberties with it https://twitter.com/MrMasonMills/status/1258725513226522624 …

Build houses, employ people and give them somewhere to live. Borrowing has never been cheaper and high debt:GDP hasn’t done Japan any harm. That’s my non expert, massively simplistic take, but hey, it’s Twitter!
I think it’s something like 10% of Americans own 84% of stocks. Also listening to a very interesting podcast arguing that the same can be said of GDP. The person who came up with the modern version warned it should never be used as a measure of human well being.
Well, the # Indians are great at hiding stuff. They’ve been fudging their GDP growth numbers along with other economic metrics for decades. Secondly, despite the not realising or admitting it, India is a deeply corrupt country. Ask Telenor & Etisalat, they’ll tell you about it.
Tbi gdp 10% thi.. Aur ghumne me bd ab 0%
Number 1 GDP. Like I said. Why would that make you angry?
And gdp is 1.7 i guess
I don't have the time or space for this: 1) The New Deal encompased alot of programs, some good, some attrocious. 2) As many smart people say, the GDP isn't the economy, just a measure of it. (See unemployment during this period) 3) GDP includes G- government spending
The stock mkt cap to gdp ratios suggested were/are still using a 21.5T gdp number which we know is significantly lower Atlanta fed said q2 gdp is running -35% which would put stocks at over 2x run rate gdp Multiple expansion doesnt solve problems, it creates more risk https://twitter.com/GuyAdami/status/1259121736752214016 …
“America's largest state economy is California, which produced $2.75 trillion of economic output in 2017, more than the United Kingdom's GDP last year of $2.62 trillion. ... GDP in Texas was slightly higher than Canada's GDP last year of $1.65 trillion.”
Capitalism works fine in most countries. Vietnam's GDP grew last year by 13.6%. China's GDP grows by about 6 to 7 % y/y in the past 50 years. Explains demographic divide there over Hong Kong. Older Chinese have seen their standard of living rise considerably in their lifetime
According to Barclays India's GDP'll 0% till last month of this year. What'll we do of this soaring.
Also, opening the economy too early will reduce GDP will be worse for the economy and lead to more business closings going forward. Here’s an article from MIT it references countless others. There are also many other peer reviewed papers available. https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/04/08/998785/stop-covid-or-save-the-economy-we-can-do-both/ …

30 million jobs are gone. They are not coming back. The economy is not coming back. Idiots out protesting are going to kill people for nothing. It will take decades to rebuild the economy. This is far worse than the Great Depression. 30% unemployment -40 GDP. Decades of hell.
What, exactly, do you think makes up the GDP?
California is #8 in GDP per capita.
I'd rather take a few years of heavy pain than a decade (Obama Recovery). I'm was in Sweden when it did its harsh fiscal consolidation, cut govt 1/3= cut Social Security up to 13, massive deregulation and privatizion + tax cuts of 6% of GDP (Reagan 2%)= growth exploded.
His economy??? GDP, stock market returns, and job creation BEFORE THE SHUTDOWN WERE ALL WAY LOWER THAN OBAMAS. NOT EVEN CLOSE. Obama created over 220000 jobs per month, Trump 140000. Obama averaged 2.6 percent gdp, trump GDP 1.6. Before losing 21 million jobs and negative GDP.
Gdp is is bellow 2%. Whos gone buy new vehicle
I don't know what more fans on here will do to his brands Value/GDP? And he knows that ...
